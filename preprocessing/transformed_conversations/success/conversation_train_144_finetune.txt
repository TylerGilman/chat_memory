2024-04-03 14:32 | You: I wish we had hired a professional person to film it. Instead of asking your friend Lenny to do it.
2024-04-03 14:35 | Samantha: This video isn't so bad. The quality isn't the best, but he does a pretty good job.
2024-04-03 14:37 | You: It's not bad if you like your unclear video. There are no changes between scenes and the lighting is terrible. At best, it looks like a rough video that has not been completely edited.
2024-04-03 14:40 | Samantha: It is a little rough, I admit.
2024-04-03 14:41 | You: There are problems with the audio, too. Some sections are no sound when the audio is cut. And when there is the audio, the volume isn't the same.
2024-04-03 14:43 | Samantha: That's true. I guess, he'll do better next time.
2024-05-17 10:05 | Samantha: Hey, I talked to Lenny and he feels bad about how the video turned out. He offered to re-edit it for us for free. What do you think?
2024-05-17 10:12 | You: I don't know, the issues seem pretty fundamental, not just an editing problem. I'm skeptical he can fix it in post.
2024-05-17 10:15 | Samantha: I hear you, but he seemed eager to try to make it right. It can't hurt to let him take another stab at it, right? We don't have much to lose at this point.
2024-05-17 10:18 | You: I guess you're right, what's the harm in letting him try again. But I'm not getting my hopes up. Let's see what he comes back with.
2024-06-05 16:47 | You: Did you have a chance to review Lenny's new edit? I took a look and I'm still seeing a lot of problems. Some scenes are better but the audio is still a mess and the coloring is inconsistent.
2024-06-05 16:52 | Samantha: Yeah, I noticed that too. Damn. I really hoped he could clean it up and save us from having to start over.
2024-06-05 16:54 | You: At this point, I think we need to bring in a professional editor for rescue editing. It will cost us, but I don't see another way to get this footage to a usable place.
2024-06-05 16:57 | Samantha: You're probably right. It sucks to spend the extra money but we can't use it as-is. Can you get some quotes from professional post-production houses?
2024-06-05 17:01 | You: Sure, I'll request a few estimates and let you know what I find out. Hopefully we can find someone good who's still within budget.
2024-06-14 11:22 | You: I heard back from a few editing companies. To do all the editing, color correction, audio mixing, and final output we're looking at around $2500-3000 based on the quotes. What do you think?
2024-06-14 11:30 | Samantha: Ouch, that's a lot. But I agree it needs to be done to save this project. I can cover half if you can cover the other half.
2024-06-14 11:34 | You: Deal, I'll send over the 50% deposit today and get them started. They said it will take about 2-3 weeks to complete. Fingers crossed this is the last major hurdle.
2024-06-14 11:37 | Samantha: Great, keep me posted! And hey, thanks for staying on top of this and pushing to make it better. I know it's been a hassle.
2024-07-08 13:03 | You: The final edited video just came back from the pros. It looks fantastic! Night and day difference from what we started with.
2024-07-08 13:05 | Samantha: Oh awesome! I can't wait to see it. I'm so relieved we were able to get it polished up.
2024-07-08 13:09 | You: Seriously, it's like a whole new video. Worth every penny to get it done right. I'm going to send them the final payment. Thanks for working with me to find a solution. I know it ended up costing more than we hoped.
2024-07-08 13:13 | Samantha: Of course, it's a shared project so shared responsibility. I really appreciate you taking the lead to get it sorted out. Excited to finally be able to share the finished product!
2024-07-08 13:16 | You: Me too! I'll send you the final link once I upload it. Glad we got it over the finish line together.
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Samantha regarding the video project over the past few months. It started back in early April when you expressed disappointment with her friend Lenny's amateur videography work. Despite Samantha trying to defend him initially, she came around to agreeing the quality was subpar. 

In mid-May, about a month later, Samantha reached out saying Lenny offered to re-edit the footage for free. You were skeptical but decided to give him another chance. However, by early June the revised edit still had many issues. Frustrated, you told Samantha you wanted to hire a professional editor to salvage the project.

After getting quotes, in mid-June you and Samantha agreed to split the cost of hiring a pro editor. The professional delivered much higher quality work a few weeks later in early July. Relieved, you thanked Samantha for working with you to find a solution, even if it cost more than originally planned. She appreciated your patience and willingness to invest in doing it right.

Now, in mid-July, you're both very happy with the final edited video. It's a huge improvement from Lenny's initial attempt back in the spring. While it was a long few months getting here, you're pleased with the end result and proud of the finished product. The experience taught you the importance of hiring skilled professionals from the start of creative projects.
