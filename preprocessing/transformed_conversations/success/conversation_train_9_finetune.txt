    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with Person2 over the past several months. Back in early June, you first reached out to them asking for directions to the visa office, as you had an important interview coming up. Person2 kindly offered to walk you there, and during that initial conversation, you mentioned you were hoping to study English Literature abroad. Over the next few weeks, you had a couple more check-ins with Person2, who was curious to know how your visa application process was going. You shared that this would be your third interview, as you'd already been through a couple earlier ones. 

Just last week, you had another exchange with Person2, where they asked if you had received your visa yet. You explained that you were still waiting, but felt optimistic after this latest interview. Throughout this entire process, Person2 has been a helpful and supportive resource, offering encouragement and advice as you navigate the complexities of studying internationally. I'm glad you've had their assistance during this important endeavor. Let me know if there's anything else I can do to support you moving forward.
