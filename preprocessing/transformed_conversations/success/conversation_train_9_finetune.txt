2024-05-02 11:01 | Alex: Hey, how's the document gathering going?
2024-05-02 11:26 | You: Slowly but surely. The school is sending my acceptance letter this week and then I'll submit everything.

2024-06-12 09:29 | You: My program starts in September, so I'll head over in about 2 months. And definitely, let's grab dinner or something soon!
2024-07-28 18:37 | Alex: Hey there, how go the study abroad preparations?
2024-07-28 18:45 | You: Hey! It's been a bit of a whirlwind getting everything lined up but I'm getting really excited now that it's only a month away! I booked my flight last week.
2024-07-28 18:47 | Alex: That's so great! What a cool adventure. You'll have to tell me all about the program and your plans.
2024-07-28 18:52 | You: For sure! It's a year-long immersive lit program at Oxford. I'll actually be staying at one of the colleges right in the city center.
2024-07-28 18:54 | You: I'm trying to get ahead on the reading list now and it looks amazing. Lots of classic British lit as well as some more contemporary world literature.
2024-07-28 18:57 | Alex: Man, what an incredible opportunity. Oxford is such a beautiful place too. You'll have to send me lots of pics of all the old buildings!
2024-07-28 19:01 | You: Oh definitely! I can't wait to explore the city. But I'm sure I'll be spending a ton of time in the Bodleian Library too. Apparently it's one of the oldest in Europe!
2024-07-28 19:04 | Alex: Wow that's so cool! Well sounds like you're going to have an amazing time. We'll have to meet up again before you go so I can hear even more about it!
2024-07-28 19:06 | You: 100%! I'll text you soon and we'll get something on the calendar before I take off. Can't wait to catch up more!
2024-08-09 20:14 | You: Hey Alex, I just wanted to say thank you again for all your help and support these past several months. I don't think I ever properly thanked you for showing me to the visa office that first day way back in February!
2024-08-09 20:15 | You: You've been so great to chat with throughout this whole long process and I really appreciate your excitement for me. It's been awesome having a friend to share the ups and downs with.
2024-08-09 20:18 | Alex: Aw of course! I've been so happy to follow along on this journey with you. Crazy to think it all started with a chance encounter outside the visa office!
2024-08-09 20:19 | Alex: You're going to do such incredible things over there and I can't wait to hear all about them. I'm always here to cheer you on!
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Alex regarding your visa application process over the past several months:

Back in early February, about 6 months ago, you ran into Alex near the visa office when you were heading in for one of your interviews. Alex helpfully showed you the way and you had a brief conversation about your plans to study English Literature abroad. 

A month later in March, Alex messaged to check in on how your visa process was going. You shared that you had completed a couple more interviews but were still waiting on a decision. In April, 3 months ago, you excitedly let Alex know that your student visa had been conditionally approved, pending submission of a few final documents and your acceptance letter.

As you worked to get everything in order, you and Alex texted a bit less frequently, with just a couple quick exchanges in May about gathering all the required paperwork. Then in mid-June, only 2 months back, you messaged with the great news that your visa had been officially approved and you would be able to go abroad to study in the fall.

Since then, you and Alex have chatted a handful of times about your preparations, with a longer conversation a few weeks ago in late July to catch up on the details of your move. And just last week, you sent a message thanking Alex again for his help and support throughout this months-long process.

So in summary, what started as a chance encounter back in February when Alex helped you find the visa office, has turned into a friendship over the past half year as Alex has followed along with your visa journey, from the early interviews, to the conditional approval, final submission, and now preparing for your exciting studies abroad starting next month.
