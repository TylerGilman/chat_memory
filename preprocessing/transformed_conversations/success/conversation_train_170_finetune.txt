2024-05-06 09:22 | You: Hey Albert, could you co-sign this approval sheet for the new fax machine? Accounting is getting really strict with these.
2024-05-06 09:35 | Albert: I know, they've sent back two of my approvals already. No problem, where do I need to sign?
2024-05-06 09:37 | You: Right here at the bottom. Thanks, I appreciate it! Hopefully this one goes through.
2024-05-06 09:40 | Albert: There you go, all signed. Hope you don't have as many issues as I did! Let me know when it arrives.
2024-05-20 11:03 | You: Albert, just wanted to let you know the new fax machine arrived. Having some trouble getting it set up though.
2024-05-20 11:15 | Albert: Oh no, what kind of issues are you seeing? I can come take a look when I have a chance if needed.
2024-06-07 14:28 | You: Hey, just wondering if you had any time to stop by and check out this fax machine? Still can't get it working right.
2024-06-07 14:30 | Albert: Sorry, been swamped. What's it doing? Did you open a ticket with IT?
2024-06-07 14:33 | You: Says it's not detecting a dial tone. I called IT but they're stumped too. Starting to think it's defective...
2024-06-07 14:37 | Albert: Ugh okay. You know what, I'll reach out to the vendor directly and see what they say. This is getting ridiculous.
2024-06-07 14:40 | You: Thanks, I'd really appreciate that. Keep me posted. Accounting's asking for those reports and I'm still faxing them the old way!
2024-07-12 16:55 | Albert: Good news! I got the vendor to agree to send us a replacement fax machine, no charge. Should arrive early next week.
2024-07-12 17:02 | You: Wow, that's great! Thanks for going to bat for us on that. Hopefully this next one actually works out of the box.
2024-07-12 17:06 | Albert: No kidding! I'll believe it when I see it. But yeah, glad we got it sorted out. I'll let you know when it gets here.
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Albert over the last few months regarding the approval sheet for the new fax machine:

It started back in early May when you asked Albert to co-sign the approval sheet that Accounting was being picky about. He agreed and signed it, hoping you wouldn't have the same problems he did. A couple weeks later in mid-May, you messaged Albert letting him know the fax machine arrived but there were some issues setting it up. He offered to come take a look when he had a chance. Then in early June, you had a more detailed discussion about the ongoing problems with the fax machine and how IT couldn't figure it out either. Albert mentioned he would talk to the vendor directly. Finally, just last week, Albert informed you that the vendor agreed to replace the fax machine free of charge and the new one should arrive in a few days. So after a few months of hassles, it looks like the fax machine situation should be fully resolved soon.
