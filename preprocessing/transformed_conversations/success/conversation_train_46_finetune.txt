2024-03-05 09:32 | You: Mister Ewing said we should show up at the conference center at 4 o'clock, right?
2024-03-05 09:35 | Emily: Yes, he specially asked us not to be late. Some of the people from our East York branch office are coming and he wants to make a good impression on them. How are you getting there?
2024-03-05 09:37 | You: I was thinking of taking my car but I think I'm just going to take the underground because there is construction on the highway. What about you?
2024-03-05 09:39 | Emily: I'll be taking the underground as well. Why don't we go together? I've been to the conference center only once, and I'm not sure if I can find my way around there.

2024-04-16 10:22 | You: I've been thinking more about the project idea we discussed when we met up after the conference. I really think we could put together a strong proposal. What do you think?

[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Emily over the past couple months regarding the conference and related events:

Back in early March, about 2 months ago, you and Emily were planning to attend a conference together at Mister Ewing's request. You decided to take the underground to arrive on time and make a good impression. The conference ended up going well, and the following week, Emily suggested meeting up to discuss potential collaboration opportunities that came out of it. In mid-April, you had a productive brainstorming session and decided to put together a joint proposal. After a few weeks of hard work, you submitted the proposal earlier this month. Just yesterday, Emily excitedly messaged you that the proposal was accepted! Looking back, that initial conference set off a chain of events that has led to an exciting new project for you and Emily to tackle together. It's amazing to see how much has progressed in a relatively short time.
