2024-01-15 14:05 | You: It's a terrible day, isn't it?
2024-01-15 14:06 | Xiao: Yes, it is. This is why our flight was delayed for 2 hours. My parents should be worried about me. They are waiting for me at London airport.
2024-01-15 14:07 | You: Where did you come from?
2024-01-15 14:08 | Xiao: Beijing. I was there for a 2 weeks' conference on space technology.
2024-01-15 14:09 | You: How interesting! I was there for tour. You see, I usually have a tour twice or 3 times a year.
2024-01-15 14:10 | Xiao: Really? Which places did you visit in China?
2024-01-15 14:11 | You: Apart from Beijing, we went to Nanjing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou.
2024-01-15 14:12 | Xiao: Did you enjoy it?
2024-01-15 14:13 | You: Very much. It was one of the most exciting tours I've ever made. Was this your first trip to China?
2024-01-15 14:14 | Xiao: Oh, no. I go almost every year. Unfortunately, it's always on space related business. I haven't had time to visit tour sites.
2024-01-15 14:15 | You: Oh, what a pity.
2024-02-08 10:32 | Xiao: Hey there, just wanted to check in and see how you've been doing since we got back from our trips!

2024-05-17 19:15 | You: Oh Xiao, I'm so sorry to hear that. I can only imagine how frustrating that must be after all your hard work. Want to hop on a call? I'm here to listen.
2024-05-17 19:17 | Xiao: I might take you up on that in a bit, thanks. I think I just need a little time to process first. It's tough, I had my heart really set on this opportunity.
2024-05-17 19:20 | You: I completely understand. Take all the time you need. I'm here whenever you're ready to talk, vent, strategize next steps, or anything else. You'll bounce back from this, I know it.
2024-07-10 14:28 | Xiao: I wanted to share an update - I've decided to start applying for positions at other space agencies, including a few in Europe. I realized I might need to broaden my horizons to find the right growth opportunities.
2024-07-10 14:34 | You: Xiao, I think that's a great idea! Your skills would be an asset to any space agency team. Excited to see where this takes you. Let me know if you need any help with applications!

2024-07-10 14:43 | You: That's the spirit! Onwards and upwards, my friend. I'm confident great things are in store.
2024-08-22 08:15 | Xiao: You'll never believe it - I got the job!!! I'm going to be leading a satellite design team at the European Space Agency!
2024-08-22 08:23 | You: Xiao, that's phenomenal news!!! I'm over the moon for you, pun intended. You deserve this so much. When do you start? How are you feeling?
2024-08-22 08:27 | Xiao: Thank you!!! I'm thrilled and a little overwhelmed - it all happened so fast! I'll be moving to Germany in October. Lots to coordinate but I couldn't be more excited for this next chapter.
2024-08-22 08:30 | You: Germany, wow! What an adventure. I know you're going to do amazing things there. Keep me posted on the move - I'd love to visit once you're settled! And remember, I'm always just a message away, no matter the time zone.
2024-08-22 08:34 | Xiao: You're the best. I'll definitely keep you updated! And I would love to show you around Germany once I'm there. Here's to new beginnings and enduring friendships!
2024-09-18 13:02 | You: Hey Xiao, I've been reflecting a lot on our friendship lately. I'm so grateful to have met you and been part of your journey over these past months, from chance airport encounter to cheering on your new ESA role. I'm really going to miss our in-person chats but I'm so proud of you for chasing your dreams. Can't wait to see all you accomplish, and to continue our thoughtful convos, even from afar!
2024-09-18 13:09 | Xiao: I've been feeling the same way - I feel so lucky to have a friend like you who I can share my hopes, dreams and challenges with. You've been such a steadfast support through all my ups and downs. I'll miss our face-to-face talks too but I know our friendship will continue to grow, no matter the distance. Thank you for always being there and believing in me. It means more than you know. To many more years of friendship and deep conversation!
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Xiao over the past several months. It all started back on January 15th when you two first met at the airport in London and bonded over your shared experience of a frustrating flight delay. Xiao mentioned being in Beijing for a space technology conference, while you had just gotten back from an exciting multi-city tour of China. 

In the weeks that followed, you kept in touch, with Xiao checking in to see how you were doing in early February. By late March, Xiao shared the exciting news that the space agency was considering him for a promotion to Project Manager for an upcoming lunar mission. You offered hearty congratulations.

However, in May, Xiao revealed that he was passed over for the promotion, much to his disappointment. You listened supportively as he processed the letdown. Determined to keep moving forward in his career, in July Xiao told you he had applied to several positions at other space agencies in Europe. After an intense round of interviews in August, just last week Xiao excitedly announced that he had accepted a dream job at the European Space Agency and would be moving to Germany in October. 

While bittersweet to see him leave China, you're thrilled that your friendship that started with a chance airport encounter has grown to span continents as you've supported each other through ups and downs. Xiao's resilience and passion for his field have inspired you. As he embarks on this exciting new chapter, you look forward to seeing where his career takes him next, and to many more thoughtful conversations, even if they end up being more remote than those early in-person chats.
