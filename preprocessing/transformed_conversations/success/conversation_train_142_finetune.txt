[CHAT MESSAGES]
2024-05-03 14:32 | You: Mr. Snow, thanks for meeting with me. I know this isn't easy, but I need to ask you some questions about the attack last night. What time did you leave your office?
2024-05-03 14:33 | Mr. Snow: It was about 9:44pm. I remember looking at my watch right before locking up.
2024-05-03 14:34 | You: Okay, and what happened next? Did you see the attacker at all?
2024-05-03 14:36 | Mr. Snow: No, he had a stocking over his head. I was just walking to my car and suddenly got hit from behind. Next thing I knew I was waking up in the hospital with a broken leg. Apparently the paramedics dropped me loading me in the ambulance.
2024-05-03 14:38 | You: I'm sorry to hear that. Don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this. Get some rest for now and let me know if you remember anything else.
2024-05-10 10:03 | You: Hi Mr. Snow, just wanted to follow up on a couple things from your statement last week. You said you left at 9:44, but one of your coworkers thought they saw you around 10pm. Any chance you left later than you thought?
2024-05-10 10:10 | Mr. Snow: No, I'm positive it was 9:44. I had been watching the clock, eager to get home. Maybe Bill was confused or saw someone else?
2024-05-10 10:11 | You: Possibly. I'll check with him again. Also, the hospital said your leg fracture was from a fall, not a direct hit. I know you were hazy after the attack, but you're sure you didn't fall or trip at any point?
2024-05-10 10:15 | Mr. Snow: It's still a bit of a blur, but I don't think so? I just remember the sharp pain in my head, then waking up injured. You don't think I'm making this up, do you??
2024-05-10 10:17 | You: Not at all, just trying to get all the facts straight. Sit tight, we'll figure this out. Let me know if anything else comes to mind.
2024-06-16 16:20 | You: Some good news in your case, Mr. Snow. Security cameras from the parking garage confirm someone fleeing the scene around 9:50pm that night, matching the attacker's description. Looks like he followed you out from the building.
2024-06-16 16:27 | Mr. Snow: That's a relief, I was starting to doubt myself. Did you get a good look at him? Any chance of ID'ing the guy?
2024-06-16 16:29 | You: The image is too grainy for facial recognition, but it's a solid lead. We'll keep pursuing other angles too, like the ongoing forensic analysis. Hang in there.
2024-07-08 09:41 | Mr. Snow: I heard through the grapevine that there was an arrest made in my case? Is that true? What can you tell me?
2024-07-08 09:52 | You: Yes, we picked up a suspect a few days ago. Forensics matched DNA from the scene and he fits the description. We're confident it's our guy but still building the case before it goes to trial.
2024-07-08 09:54 | Mr. Snow: Wow, that's amazing news! I was starting to lose hope. Do you know why he did it? Was I targeted for some reason?
2024-07-08 09:56 | You: Too soon to say, but seems like a crime of opportunity. We'll know more once we finish interrogations. Sit tight a bit longer, I'll keep you posted as court dates firm up. With any luck, this will all be behind you soon.
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Mr. Snow regarding the attack investigation, dating back to early May:

You first interviewed Mr. Snow on May 3rd, the day after he was attacked leaving his office. He provided initial details, like leaving around 9:44pm and being hit on the head by an attacker in a stocking mask. You followed up a week later to clarify some inconsistencies in his story. As the investigation continued through May and June, you stayed in touch, probing for more details and updates on his condition. A major development came in mid-June when security camera footage corroborated parts of his account. Your exchanges tapered off for a few weeks until earlier this month, when the attacker was finally apprehended. Throughout this process over nearly 3 months, you developed a rapport with Mr. Snow and a clearer picture of that night's events, though some questions still remain. The upcoming trial should hopefully bring closure and resolution to this disturbing incident.
