2024-04-02 14:32 | You: Hey, would you talk to me about taking one of Dr. Miller's classes? I'm thinking about enrolling in his course next semester but not totally sure.
2024-04-02 14:35 | Friend: Yeah of course! I actually took a class with Dr. Miller before. Have you ever had him?
2024-04-02 14:37 | You: No, I haven't. I really need to learn the material well but I'm also worried about my grades...
2024-04-02 14:39 | Friend: I totally get that, grades are definitely important. But don't you think gaining the knowledge itself is just as crucial? When I had Dr. Miller, he made everything so engaging and interesting that time flew by in class. And I ended up learning a ton.
2024-04-02 14:43 | You: That's a really good point. I do want to make sure I fully grasp this stuff since it's so key for my major. Good to know he keeps things interesting!
2024-04-02 14:45 | Friend: Definitely. Oh and fun fact - did you know he actually came here last year after spending 10 years in the military? I think that background gives him a unique perspective.
2024-04-02 14:47 | You: Oh wow, I didn't realize that. Yeah, I could see how that experience would enrich his teaching. Thanks so much for the insight!
2024-04-16 11:03 | You: Hey again! I wanted to let you know I decided to go for it and register for Dr. Miller's class next semester. Fingers crossed it goes well!
2024-04-16 11:10 | Friend: That's awesome, I think you made a really solid choice. At the end of the day, you have to go with your gut and do what's best for you. I'm excited for you - hope you have a great semester!
2024-04-16 11:14 | You: Thanks, I appreciate the vote of confidence! Definitely feeling better about it after talking it through with you. Here goes nothing!
2024-08-10 17:21 | You: Hi! I know it's been a while but I wanted to check back in about Dr. Miller's class. It starts up in a couple weeks and I'm getting a bit nervous again. Any last minute advice or words of encouragement?
2024-08-10 17:29 | Friend: So great to hear from you! I'm really glad you touched base. I'm sure you're going to do great in his class. Just remember to stay engaged, soak up the knowledge, and enjoy the experience. You've got this! Feel free to reach out anytime if you need a pep talk or have questions as the semester goes on.
2024-08-10 17:34 | You: This is so reassuring and exactly what I needed to hear. I'm lucky to have you in my corner! Can't wait to dive in and make the most of it. I'll definitely keep you posted on how it's going. Thanks again, you're the best!
