2024-06-19 17:22 | Customer: Hi Alex, I picked up a takeout order about an hour ago but realized there was a mixup. I got a chicken dish instead of the steak I ordered.
2024-06-19 17:25 | You: Oh no, I'm so sorry about that! That's completely our mistake. If you're able to come back to the restaurant, I'll make sure we get the correct order out to you right away.

2024-06-19 17:29 | You: I completely understand. Let me refund you for the full order amount - you'll see that back on your card in 1-2 business days. Please give us another chance to get it right next time, on us.
2024-06-19 17:32 | Customer: Wow, thanks so much Alex. I really appreciate you making this right. Mistakes happen, and your great customer service means I'll definitely be back!

2024-08-10 13:28 | Customer: Hi Alex, I wanted to reach out and let you know that tonight will likely be my last time dining with you for a while. I'm moving away for a new job next week.
2024-08-10 13:32 | You: Wow, congratulations on the new job! That's exciting, but we will certainly miss having you as one of our loyal customers. It's been such a pleasure getting to know you over these past few months.

[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with the customer over the past few months... Back in early May, they came into the restaurant and you took their initial order for drinks, a steak dinner, and dessert. A week later, they returned and complimented the great service and food from their first visit. You got to know them a bit more personally. In mid-June, there was an issue with their takeout order being incorrect, but you handled it gracefully and provided a refund, which they greatly appreciated. Earlier this summer in July, they came in to celebrate a special occasion and you went above and beyond to make it a wonderful experience. And just last week, they stopped by to let you know they are moving away but wanted to thank you for the consistently stellar service over the past few months. It's been a pleasure getting to know this customer and ensuring they had positive experiences at the restaurant.
