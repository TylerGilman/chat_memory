2024-06-28 11:09 | Person2: You're right, I should have been more open. I guess I just didn't think it was that big of a deal at the time.
2024-06-28 11:13 | You: Well it is a big deal to me. I care about you and I want to know what's going on in your life.

    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with Person2 over the past few months. Back in early May, you were surprised and upset to learn that Person2 had a girlfriend that they were planning to marry. You felt blindsided, as they had never mentioned this important relationship detail to you before. Over the next several weeks, you continued to express your frustration with Person2 for keeping you in the dark. They acknowledged their oversight, but you remained perturbed that they didn't think to share this information with you earlier. Just last week, you two had another heated discussion about the situation, with you accusing Person2 of not caring about your feelings on the matter. While the conversations have been tense, it's clear this is an issue that has been weighing on you for some time now. I hope you're able to work through this with Person2 and find a resolution that leaves you feeling heard and respected.
