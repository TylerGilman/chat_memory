    2024-06-05 10:15 | You: This is a good basic computer package. It's got a good CPU, 256 megabytes of RAM, and a DVD player.
2024-06-05 10:17 | Person2: Does it come with a modem?
2024-06-05 10:19 | You: Yes, it has a built-in modem. You just plug a phone line into the back of the computer.
2024-06-05 10:21 | Person2: How about the monitor?
2024-06-05 10:23 | You: A 15 - inch monitor is included in the deal. If you want, you can switch it for a 17 - inch monitor, for a little more money.
2024-06-05 10:25 | Person2: That's okay. A 15 - inch is good enough. All right, I'll take it.
2024-06-12 14:32 | Person2: Just following up on that computer package we discussed last week. When can I come pick it up?
2024-06-12 14:35 | You: Great, let's get that scheduled. I have availability on Thursday afternoon or Saturday morning - which works better for you?
2024-06-12 14:38 | Person2: Saturday morning would be perfect. What time should I plan to swing by?
2024-06-12 14:41 | You: How about 10am? I'll have the system all set up and ready for you.
2024-06-12 14:43 | Person2: Sounds good, I'll see you then. Thanks again for your help!
2024-06-15 10:05 | Person2: Just wanted to let you know I'm on my way to pick up the computer.
2024-06-15 10:07 | You: Excellent, I'll be here waiting. Drive safely and I'll have everything ready for you when you arrive.
2024-06-15 10:35 | Person2: Just got here, the computer looks great! I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through the options.
2024-06-15 10:38 | You: I'm so glad you're happy with it. Let me know if you have any other questions as you get it set up at home.
    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with Person2 over the past few months. Back in early June, you first showed them a basic computer package with a good CPU, 256MB of RAM, and a DVD player. They were interested, but wanted to know if it came with a modem and what size monitor was included. You were able to confirm the built-in modem and 15-inch monitor, and even offered the option to upgrade to a 17-inch for a bit more. Person2 decided the 15-inch was sufficient, and agreed to purchase the package. 

Over the next several weeks, you followed up with Person2 to finalize the details and get the transaction completed. They seemed very satisfied with the computer setup and thanked you for your help in selecting the right system to meet their needs. This was an important sale that helped grow your small business, and I'm glad the process went smoothly from start to finish. Let me know if there's anything else I can do to support you moving forward.
