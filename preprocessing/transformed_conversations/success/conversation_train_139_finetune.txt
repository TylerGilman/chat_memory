2024-05-03 18:32 | You: Hey Sarah, who was that guy you were talking to at the bar last night? It looked like he was hitting on you.
2024-05-03 18:40 | Sarah: Yeah, we struck up a conversation, and eventually he asked me out. I gave him my number, but I'm not sure if I'll actually go out with him.
2024-05-03 18:41 | You: Oh? How come?
2024-05-03 18:45 | Sarah: He's nice, but I just don't feel like we have much chemistry, so I don't want to lead him on.
2024-05-03 18:47 | You: Well, don't be too quick to judge. My last boyfriend and I didn't hit it off right away, I only started to fall for him after we went out a few times and I got to know him better. We were together for 3 years.
2024-05-03 18:52 | Sarah: So why'd you split up? If you don't mind my asking.
2024-05-03 18:53 | You: Not at all. We just started to drift apart, different interests, different plans for the future. The breakup was mutual.
2024-05-28 20:03 | Sarah: Ugh, thinking about that guy from the bar is reminding me of my last relationship. It was such a nightmare.
2024-05-28 20:05 | You: Oh no, what happened?
2024-05-28 20:10 | Sarah: I hooked up with a guy at a New Year's party and we were together for six months, but we were constantly fighting and making up. I don't know how I put up with him for so long.
2024-05-28 20:11 | You: That sounds awful. How did it finally end?
2024-05-28 20:15 | Sarah: I caught him cheating on me, making out with his ex. He begged for another chance, but I knew he was just trying to jerk me around, so I said no.
2024-05-28 20:16 | You: Good for you for being strong and ending it. You deserve so much better.
2024-05-28 20:18 | Sarah: Thanks. I appreciate you listening. So anyway, how about you - are you seeing anyone at the moment?
2024-06-15 17:05 | You: To answer your question from before, I've been on a few casual dates recently but nothing serious.
2024-06-15 17:07 | Sarah: No one special catching your eye?
2024-06-15 17:10 | You: Not really. To be honest, I'm pretty content with single life right now. Focusing on myself and my friendships.
2024-06-15 17:13 | Sarah: I admire that. There's no need to rush into a relationship until you feel ready.
2024-06-15 17:15 | You: Exactly. I'm sure I'll know when I meet the right person. But for now I'm happy as I am.
2024-07-18 13:41 | Sarah: Remember that guy Mark I was unsure about? The one from the bar a couple months ago?
2024-07-18 13:45 | You: Yeah, what about him? Did you ever meet up?
2024-07-18 13:50 | Sarah: I did actually. We've been on a few dates now and it's going really well! You were right about not judging too fast.
2024-07-18 13:52 | You: That's great, I'm so happy for you! What changed your mind about him?
2024-07-18 13:58 | Sarah: I just felt more of a connection as we talked more. He's really thoughtful and makes me laugh. I'm excited to see where it goes.
2024-07-18 14:02 | You: Keep me posted! Rooting for you.
2024-08-07 16:22 | You: Hey, how are things going with Mark? Still happy?
2024-08-07 16:30 | Sarah: Actually, not so great... We had a talk and he said he really likes me but isn't ready for a serious commitment.
2024-08-07 16:33 | You: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Are you okay? What did you say to him?
2024-08-07 16:40 | Sarah: I told him I understand but that I'm looking for something real, not casual dating. So we decided to stop seeing each other. It sucks because I really started to fall for him. But I know I did the right thing.
2024-08-07 16:43 | You: Ugh, breakups are the worst, even if it's the right call. Proud of you for standing up for what you want though. I'm here if you need anything.
2024-08-07 16:45 | Sarah: Thanks so much, you're the best. I may take you up on some ice cream and trash TV soon.
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Sarah over the past few months regarding relationships. It started back in early May when you asked about the guy she met at the bar. She wasn't sure about him at first, but you encouraged her not to judge too quickly, sharing how your own relationship took time to develop. As you opened up more in late May, Sarah shared about her last toxic relationship that ended with her ex cheating. You supported her decision to end it. In June, the topic shifted to your own dating life, with you expressing contentment with being single for now. By mid-July, Sarah revealed she decided to give the bar guy (Mark) a chance and they had been on a few great dates. However, just last week in early August, Sarah confided in you that Mark said he wasn't ready for commitment, leading to a tough conversation. Throughout this period, you provided a listening ear and advice when needed, strengthening your friendship.
