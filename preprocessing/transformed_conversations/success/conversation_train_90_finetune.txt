2024-02-18 14:35 | Daniel: Is that different from this kind of zoo?
2024-02-18 14:37 | You: Yes, of course.
2024-02-18 14:39 | Daniel: So tell me about it!
2024-02-18 14:42 | You: There are a lot of wild animals in that place, and also some special rules while visiting.
2024-02-18 14:44 | Daniel: Special rules?
2024-02-18 14:45 | You: There, you only have two ways for visiting.
2024-02-18 14:47 | Daniel: Details?
2024-02-18 14:50 | You: On their bus or in your own cars, and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region.
2024-02-18 14:52 | Daniel: Why not?
2024-02-18 14:55 | You: Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus. You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be.
