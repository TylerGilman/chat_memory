[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Martin over the past several months:

You first reconnected with Martin in mid-April after not seeing him for a long time. He had just returned from studying in France and traveling around Europe. The two of you met up that same evening to catch up in person. 

In early May, Martin messaged to let you know his mother's 70th birthday celebration plans were coming together. A few weeks later, he shared photos from their family trip to the coast. You checked in with him in early June right before he headed back to France.

Martin reached out in July once he was settled back in Paris, describing his new apartment and neighborhood. You had a long phone call in late July hearing about his first few weeks of classes.

Earlier this month, Martin called you excited that his girlfriend would be joining him in France for the fall semester. He thanked you for your support and friendship these past months during his transition.

Overall, it's been wonderful to reconnect with Martin and hear about his adventures studying abroad. His move back to France in June was a big change, but he seems to be thriving. Your consistent check-ins and longer calls have helped maintain a strong friendship despite the distance. With his girlfriend moving to Paris soon, it will be interesting to see how their relationship develops. You're grateful to be a steady presence as Martin navigates this exciting time in his life.
