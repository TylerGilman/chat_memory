    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with Judy Liao over the past several months. Back in early June, Judy reached out to inquire about the accounts assistant position and confirm that you had received her job application, which included her resume, cover letter, and recommendation letters. You were able to locate her materials in your system and assure her that everything was in order. 

A few weeks later in late June, Judy followed up again to ask about the status of the hiring process and when interviews might start. At that time, you explained that the review of applications was still ongoing, but that they hoped to begin scheduling interviews within the next 1-2 weeks. Judy seemed satisfied with that timeline.

Just last month in early August, Judy stopped by your office in person to reiterate her interest in the role and see if there were any updates. You were able to confirm that her application was still under consideration, and you encouraged her to reach out if she had any other questions.

Based on our conversation history, it seems Judy has been diligently following up on her application and remains enthusiastic about the opportunity. I'd recommend keeping her updated on the hiring process as it progresses, as her persistence and proactive communication suggest she could be a strong candidate for the accounts assistant role.
