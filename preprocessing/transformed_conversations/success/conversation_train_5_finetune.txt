[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Aims over the past few months, Lisa. It all started back on January 12th, Aims' birthday, when you gave her a thoughtful present that she absolutely loved. She was so appreciative and introduced you to some of her friends at the party. 

Then in early February, about three weeks later, you reached out to see how she was enjoying the gift. Aims raved about how much use she's gotten out of it and shared a funny story. You two had a nice catch up.

A month after that in early March, Aims messaged you out of the blue asking for some advice on a tricky situation at work. You had a really meaningful, in-depth discussion and she said your perspective was super helpful. It brought you closer as friends.

Most recently, just last week, you invited Aims to join you for a weekend getaway with some other friends in a few months. She was thrilled about the idea and you started excitedly planning the details together. 

It's been really nice to see your friendship grow stronger over these past few months through these conversations and shared moments. You've been there for each other through celebrations, day-to-day life, and challenges. Aims clearly values your opinion and support a lot. Planning the upcoming trip together shows how much your friendship has deepened. Keep nurturing this lovely connection!
