[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Sarah over the past few months regarding her pregnancy and childbirth. Back in early May, Sarah first told you that she was pregnant but her husband Mr. Schmidt was away and unreachable. You expressed surprise that he would be coming home to big news. 

A week later in mid-May, Sarah shared that her older sister Judy would be coming to help, since Judy already had two kids of her own. Later that same day, you saw a red van pull up and asked if it was Judy arriving.

Then in early June, about a month after first learning of the pregnancy, Sarah messaged to let you know she was heading to the hospital and that Judy was driving her. The next day, Sarah sent a photo of her healthy newborn baby girl. 

A couple weeks after that in late June, you checked in and Sarah said adjusting to caring for a newborn was hard but that Judy had been a huge help. She also mentioned her husband would be home soon.

Finally, just last week, Sarah excitedly told you that her husband had returned home and was overjoyed to meet his new daughter for the first time. 

So in summary, over the past two and a half months, you've followed Sarah's journey from first learning of her pregnancy in early May, to her sister arriving to help in mid-May, the birth of her daughter in early June, and her husband's return home just last week in mid-July to meet his new child. It's been quite an eventful time in Sarah's life with many big developments and changes.
