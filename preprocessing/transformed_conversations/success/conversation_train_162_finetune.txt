2024-04-03 14:32 | You: Hey, Frank, there is that Janet Check.
2024-04-03 14:33 | Frank: Wow, what a great burd!
2024-04-03 14:33 | You: She sure knows how to strut her stuff.
2024-04-03 14:34 | Frank: She's a real turn-on our rights.
2024-04-03 14:35 | You: And look out she's dressed.
2024-04-03 14:36 | Frank: Yeah, I noticed. She must be really loaded.
2024-04-03 14:37 | You: No way. Her old man is rich. He buys her anything she wants.
2024-04-03 14:39 | Frank: Lucky her. Anyway, I think that is just as beautiful.
2024-04-03 14:40 | You: I think you've lost it.
2024-04-03 14:41 | Frank: Well, that's my opinion.
2024-04-03 14:42 | You: I admit that she is much prettier than Kate.
2024-04-03 14:43 | Frank: Oh, there is no comparison. Now we are talking but ugly.
2024-04-03 14:44 | You: At least we agree on that. Let's go and get a drink.
2024-04-16 19:03 | You: I heard Janet Check showed up to the gala last night decked out in diamonds.
2024-04-16 19:05 | Frank: Yep, she looked absolutely stunning as always. Her dad's money at work!
2024-04-16 19:06 | You: Must be nice to have an endless clothing and jewelry budget.
2024-04-16 19:08 | Frank: I'll say. She really is in a league of her own looks and money-wise.
2024-05-07 11:15 | Frank: Ran into Kate at the coffee shop. Yikes, not looking so great.
2024-05-07 11:17 | You: Yeah, I hate to say it but Janet Check makes Kate look like a troll.
2024-05-07 11:18 | Frank: Haha, no doubt! Janet is just flawless.
2024-06-12 16:28 | Frank: Guess who I had the pleasure of chatting with at the children's hospital benefit?
2024-06-12 16:30 | You: Hmm...could it be a certain Janet Check by chance?
2024-06-12 16:32 | Frank: Bingo! We really connected. She's not just a pretty face - she's got a great heart too. I'm thinking of asking her out.
2024-06-12 16:33 | You: Wow, go for it man! You two would be a real power couple!
2024-07-08 21:02 | You: Hey buddy, how are things going with Janet? Haven't heard you mention her lately.
2024-07-08 21:10 | Frank: Ah, I don't know. I think the spark just fizzled out. She's a great gal but maybe not the right match for me.
2024-07-08 21:14 | You: Sorry to hear that. But hey, plenty of fish in the sea right? Hang in there.
2024-07-08 21:17 | Frank: Thanks man. It's probably for the best. Still stings a bit though, not gonna lie.
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Frank over the past few months regarding Janet Check. It all started back in early April when you first saw Janet at some event and commented to Frank about how she really knows how to "strut her stuff." Frank was quite taken with her looks as well. A couple weeks later in mid-April, you discussed how wealthy her father is and how that allows Janet to always dress so well. Frank still thought she was the most beautiful woman around. 

In early May, the topic of Janet came up again in comparison to your mutual acquaintance Kate. You both readily agreed that Janet is far more attractive. The conversations died down for a bit after that. Then in mid-June, Frank mentioned he ran into Janet at a charity function and they really hit it off. He seemed quite smitten. However, by early July he confided in you that things had cooled off with Janet and he was feeling a bit down about it. You commiserated and suggested maybe it was for the best.

Now today, August 17th, as I review your message history, it seems Janet hasn't come up in conversation for over a month now. It was an interesting few months back in the spring and early summer as you and Frank discussed this alluring woman who captured Frank's eye for a time. But as these things often go, Frank's infatuation eventually ran its course. Let me know if you need anything else!
