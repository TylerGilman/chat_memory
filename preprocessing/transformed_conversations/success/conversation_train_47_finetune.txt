    2024-05-03 16:22 | You: What's the accommodation like in London Ahmed?
2024-05-03 16:25 | Ahmed: Well, it's a bit difficult. There are thousands of overseas students here, you know.
2024-05-03 16:27 | You: Would it be better to stay in a hotel, to share a flat, or to stay with a family?
2024-05-03 16:30 | Ahmed: It would probably be better to stay with a family to begin with, Carla.
2024-05-03 16:32 | You: You wouldn't recommend sharing a flat?
2024-05-03 16:34 | Ahmed: No, I wouldn't move into a flat if I were you. You won't get much studying done in a flat. You'll spend half your time cooking and cleaning.
2024-05-03 16:36 | You: How can I find out about families who take in students?
2024-05-03 16:39 | Ahmed: There's a list at the student union building on campus. The people at the student union should be able to help you find a family to stay with.
2024-06-14 11:02 | You: Hi Ahmed, I've been looking into the host family option a bit more. Do you have any other advice on what to consider?
2024-06-14 11:05 | Ahmed: Well, I'd recommend trying to find a family that has experience hosting international students. That way they'll be more prepared to support you and make you feel comfortable. Also, ask about things like meal plans, curfews, and house rules so you know what to expect.
2024-06-14 11:08 | You: Okay, that's really helpful. I'll keep those factors in mind as I look through the listings. Thanks again for your guidance!
2024-07-11 14:17 | You: Hi Ahmed, I wanted to give you an update on my housing situation. After considering a few different host family options, I've decided to go with the Johnson family. They seem really nice and have hosted students before.
2024-07-11 14:21 | Ahmed: That's great to hear, Carla! The Johnsons are a lovely family and I think you'll be very comfortable there. Let me know if you have any other questions as you get settled in.
2024-07-11 14:24 | You: Will do, thanks so much. I really appreciate all your help throughout this process.
    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with Ahmed about finding accommodation in London. Back in early May, you were just starting to look into options and Ahmed recommended staying with a host family rather than sharing a flat, as that would be better for your studies. Over the next few months, you've continued to explore different living arrangements and have kept in touch with Ahmed for his insights. Just last week, you followed up with him again to get an update on the housing situation and discuss your latest plans. It's been really helpful to have Ahmed's local perspective as you navigate this process of finding the right place to live during your studies in the city.
