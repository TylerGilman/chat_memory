    [CHAT MESSAGES]
    2024-05-06 15:22 | You: What kind of music do you like listening to?
2024-05-06 15:25 | Person2: I like music that has a fast beat and is lively, like dance music. You know, I go to a disco almost every week. Sometimes it's too loud though. You prefer classical music, don't you?
2024-05-06 15:28 | You: Yes, I do. I find it very relaxing. I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work.
2024-05-06 15:31 | Person2: I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music. It's certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music.
2024-05-06 15:35 | You: Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Research suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better.
2024-05-06 15:38 | Person2: Really? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often. I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress.
2024-05-22 10:42 | Person2: I'Ve got a few classical music CD's. I should follow your lead and increase my brian power.
2024-05-22 10:45 | You: You can find plenty of recording on the internet too. You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them.
2024-05-22 10:49 | Person2: That's a good idea. You should do the same with some music. You might find something you like. Classical music might make you clever, but dance might make you livelier and happier.
2024-07-15 17:02 | You: That's true. There's clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people. Music can influence a person's feeling and character.
2024-07-15 17:06 | Person2: Exactly! I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this. Expanding our musical horizons can have such a positive impact.
