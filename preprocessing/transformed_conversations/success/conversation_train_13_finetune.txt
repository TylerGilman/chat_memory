2024-05-03 15:34 | You: Oh, I don't think he wants to. He wants to travel to several different countries around the world.

    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with Person2 over the past few months. Back in early May, you were discussing the ages of your respective friends, Keith and James. Person2 shared that Keith was 21 years old, and you revealed that James was a year older but looked younger. The conversation then shifted to your father's retirement, which had just happened the previous week. You expressed that he was looking forward to traveling the world during his golden years, rather than spending more time with his grandchildren. Person2 agreed that an active retirement sounded like a good plan. Fast forward to late June, when you followed up to ask how Person2 envisioned spending their own old age. Based on the progression of these conversations over the past couple months, it's clear you and Person2 have been reflecting on the different ways people can approach and enjoy their later years. This seems to be an ongoing discussion for you both as you contemplate your own futures.
