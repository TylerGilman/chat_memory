    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with Person2 over the past few months. Back in early April, you had just moved to the city and were trying to find your way to Central Park. You approached Person2 on the bus, who kindly offered to let you know when to get off. This initial exchange happened about two months ago. A few weeks later in late April, you had a follow-up conversation with Person2 on the bus, where they continued to provide helpful guidance and reassurance about reaching your destination. Just last week in mid-June, you had one more brief interaction, with Person2 again confirming you were on the right track. Throughout these conversations, Person2 has been extremely patient and reliable in assisting you in navigating the public transportation system and finding your way to Central Park. Their kindness and attention to detail have been greatly appreciated as you've settled into the city.
