[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with the helpful stranger on the bus over the past couple months, Person1. It all started back on April 12th when you first took that bus to Central Park and the kind passenger assisted you in knowing when to get off. She went out of her way to make sure you didn't miss your stop. 

Then about three weeks later in early May, you happened to run into her again while grabbing coffee near the park. You thanked her again for her help before and struck up a nice conversation about your shared love of Central Park in the springtime. She mentioned how she walks her dog there most mornings.

Your paths crossed once more just last week on June 10th. You were both attending an outdoor concert in the park and recognized each other in the crowd. You ended up sitting together and chatting like old friends throughout the show. She even invited you to join her and some friends for a picnic in the park next weekend. 

It's been a pleasure getting to know this thoughtful individual over the past two months, starting from that first chance encounter on the bus. Her friendliness and willingness to help a stranger have left a positive impression. And now your shared appreciation for Central Park has blossomed an unexpected friendship. Funny how a small gesture of kindness can lead to such nice connections.
