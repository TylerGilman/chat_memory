    2024-04-04 19:23 | You: Say, Lisa, what are you watching?
2024-04-04 19:25 | Lisa: A Japanese film. I'm going to spend all next year in Japan, and I'd better get to know more about its culture.
2024-04-04 19:27 | You: You mean you are accepted into the program?
2024-04-04 19:28 | Lisa: Sure.
2024-04-04 19:29 | You: That's wonderful. You must be excited.
2024-04-04 19:31 | Lisa: Excited and nervous. You know I must work on some basic conversation skills.
2024-04-04 19:33 | You: How much Japanese can you understand?
2024-04-04 19:35 | Lisa: Only a little now. But I'll attend a special language class next month.
2024-04-04 19:37 | You: I wish I were as clever as you are in foreign languages. I'd love to study abroad.
2024-04-04 19:40 | Lisa: Then why don't you? The school has a lot of programs that don't require the mastery of a foreign language. You just have to be the kind of person who is and can get used to a new environment fast.
2024-04-04 19:42 | You: I thought all programs required one to know a foreign language. Thank you for letting me know this.
2024-05-24 16:15 | Lisa: I just finished my first Japanese language class this week. It's going really well so far! I'm feeling more confident about being able to communicate when I get to Japan.
2024-05-24 16:18 | You: That's great to hear. I'm glad the class is helping prepare you. Are you starting to get excited about the big move now that you've made some progress with the language?
2024-05-24 16:21 | Lisa: Absolutely! I'm counting down the days. There's still a lot to do, but it's starting to feel real. I can't wait to immerse myself in the culture.
2024-05-24 16:24 | You: I'm sure it will be an amazing experience. Let me know if there's anything I can do to support you as you get ready to go.
2024-05-24 16:26 | Lisa: Thanks, I really appreciate that. I'll definitely keep you posted on how the preparations are going.
2024-06-28 11:02 | You: Hey Lisa, how's the Japanese language learning going these days?
2024-06-28 11:05 | Lisa: It's going great! I just finished my second course and I feel like I'm making steady progress. My pronunciation is improving a lot.
2024-06-28 11:08 | You: That's awesome. I'm sure all that practice will pay off big time when you get to Japan.
2024-06-28 11:10 | Lisa: I sure hope so! I'm trying to immerse myself as much as I can. Just watched another Japanese film last night.
2024-06-28 11:13 | You: Nice, that's a really good way to get used to hearing the language. I'm excited for you to have this incredible opportunity.
2024-06-28 11:15 | Lisa: Thanks, I'm getting more and more pumped about it every day. Just a couple more months to go!
    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with Lisa over the past few months. Back in early April, you two were chatting about her plans to spend a year in Japan. She had just been accepted into a program and was excited, but also a bit nervous about learning the language. You were impressed by her ambition and mentioned how you'd love to study abroad too, but thought you needed to be fluent in a foreign language first. 

Lisa then reassured you that the school has programs that don't require mastery of another language - you just need to be adaptable to a new environment. This was really helpful information that opened up new possibilities for you. Over the next couple of months, you and Lisa have continued discussing her preparations for the big move, like taking a Japanese language class starting last month. It's been great to see her enthusiasm grow as she gets ready for this life-changing experience. I'm glad you've had Lisa's encouragement to consider study abroad options that match your skills and interests. Let me know if you have any other questions as you explore those possibilities for yourself!
