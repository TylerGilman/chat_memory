2024-06-03 19:32 | You: I'm tired of watching television. Let's go to cinema tonight.
2024-06-03 19:33 | Alex: All right. Do you want to go downtown? Or is there a good movie in the neighborhood?
2024-06-03 19:35 | You: I'd rather not spend a lot of money. What does the paper say about neighborhood theaters?
2024-06-03 19:37 | Alex: Here's the list on page... Column 6. Here it is. Where's the Rialto? There's a perfect movie there.
2024-06-03 19:38 | You: That's too far away. And it's hard to find a place to park there.
2024-06-03 19:39 | Alex: Well, the Grand Theater has Gone with the Wind.
2024-06-03 19:40 | You: I saw that years ago. I couldn't wait to see it again. Moreover, it's too long. We wouldn't get home until midnight.
2024-06-03 19:41 | Alex: The Center has a horror film. You wouldn't want to see that?
2024-06-03 19:42 | You: No, indeed. I wouldn't be able to sleep tonight.
2024-06-03 19:43 | Alex: That's about all there is. Unless we change our decision and go downtown.
2024-06-03 19:44 | You: No, we just can't pay for it. There must be something else we haven't seen.
2024-06-03 19:45 | Alex: Here, look for yourself, I can't find anything else.
2024-06-03 19:47 | You: Look at this!
2024-06-03 19:47 | Alex: What?
2024-06-03 19:48 | You: In the television timetable, there's a baseball game on television tonight.
2024-06-03 19:49 | Alex: I wasn't looking for a TV program. I was looking at the movie ads.
2024-06-03 19:50 | You: I know, but I just happened to notice it. New York is playing Boston.
2024-06-03 19:51 | Alex: That must be good. I wouldn't mind watching that.
2024-06-03 19:52 | You: OK. Let's stay home. We can go to the cinema Friday.
2024-06-17 13:02 | You: Hey, still up for going to the movies one of these days? We never did end up going.
2024-06-17 13:15 | Alex: Yeah definitely, I'm still down! What about next Friday, the 28th?
2024-06-17 13:21 | You: Works for me. Should we see if anyone else wants to join? Could be fun with a little group.
2024-06-17 13:37 | Alex: Great idea, I'll text Jess and Manu, see if they're free. If not, no worries, we can still go just us two.
2024-07-03 17:09 | Alex: Jess and Manu are in for movie night on the 28th! I'll look into getting us tickets tonight.
2024-07-03 17:14 | You: Awesome! Keep me posted. Looking forward to it.
2024-07-03 17:45 | Alex: Got the tickets! 7pm showing at the Grand. I'll send you all the details. This is gonna be great!
2024-07-28 16:02 | Alex: Hey, I'm really sorry but I have to bail on movie night. Boss just called me in for an emergency. Rain check?
2024-07-28 16:10 | You: Oh man, that's a bummer. No worries though, I understand. Work comes first. Let's definitely rain check.
2024-07-28 16:15 | Alex: I feel awful, I know you were looking forward to this. I'll make it up to you, I promise.
2024-08-03 11:18 | Alex: Hey, I still feel bad about having to cancel movie night last week. Are you free this Saturday? Thought we could try again, just the two of us. My treat.
2024-08-03 11:29 | You: No hard feelings! I appreciate you reaching out. Saturday works great, let's do it.
2024-08-03 11:34 | Alex: Perfect. I was thinking we could grab dinner before too, make a whole night of it. What do you think?
2024-08-03 11:41 | You: Sounds like a great plan to me. It'll be nice to catch up properly. Just let me know when and where!
2024-08-12 00:02 | You: That's what friends are for! I know life gets crazy sometimes. I'm just happy we got to spend some quality time together in the end.
2024-08-12 00:05 | Alex: 100%. Well, I'm beat. Talk to you soon. Sleep well!
2024-08-12 00:06 | You: Will do, you too. Night!
2024-08-12 23:55 | You: I had a really great time tonight. Dinner was delicious and the movie was even better than I expected!
2024-08-12 23:58 | Alex: Same here, I'm so glad we finally made it happen. Thanks for being so understanding with all the plan changes. Our friendship means a lot to me.
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Alex over the past few months regarding your movie plans and how they evolved. It all started back in early June when you first suggested going to the cinema instead of watching TV at home. You looked at movie listings together but couldn't find anything suitable nearby. By chance, you noticed a baseball game on TV that night, so you decided to stay in and go to the movies another time. 

A couple weeks later in mid-June, you followed up about rescheduling your movie night. After some back and forth, you agreed on a new date and Alex suggested inviting some other friends to join. In early July, you firmed up plans with your expanded group and picked out a movie you were all excited to see. However, the day of the movie, Alex texted that something urgent came up at work and they had to cancel last minute, which was frustrating.

A month went by and in early August, Alex reached out apologizing again for the canceled plans and asking if you wanted to give the movie night another shot, just the two of you. You agreed, appreciating the gesture, and this time your plans went off without a hitch. Reflecting back on it all now in mid-August, it's funny to think how a simple movie night took two months to actually happen. But that's life sometimes - plans change, things come up. In the end, you're just glad you and Alex finally got your movie night and that your friendship stayed strong despite some bumps in the road.
