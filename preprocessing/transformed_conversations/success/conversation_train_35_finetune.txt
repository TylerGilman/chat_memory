    2024-04-04 19:23 | You: I'm tired of watching television. Let's go to cinema to- night.
2024-04-04 19:25 | Person2: All right. Do you want to go downtown? Or is there a good movie in the neighborhood?
2024-04-04 19:27 | You: I'd rather not spend a lot of money. What does the pa- per say about neighborhood theaters?
2024-04-04 19:30 | Person2: Here's the list on page... Column 6. Here it is. Where's the Rialto? There's a perfect movie there.
2024-04-04 19:32 | You: That's too far away. And it's hard to find a place to park there.
2024-04-04 19:34 | Person2: Well, the Grand Theater has Gone with the wind.
2024-04-04 19:35 | You: I saw that years ago. I couldn't wait to see it again. Moreover, it's too long. We wouldn't get home until midnight.
2024-04-04 19:37 | Person2: The Center has a horror film. You wouldn't want to see that?
2024-04-04 19:38 | You: No, indeed. I wouldn't be able to sleep tonight.
2024-04-04 19:40 | Person2: That's about ell there is. Unless we change our decision and go downtown.
2024-04-04 19:41 | You: No, we just can't pay for it. There must be something else we haven't seen.
2024-04-04 19:43 | Person2: Here, look for yourself, I can't find anything else.
2024-04-04 19:45 | You: Look at this!
2024-04-04 19:46 | Person2: What?
2024-04-04 19:47 | You: In the television timetable, there's a baseball game on television tonight.
2024-04-04 19:48 | Person2: I wasn't looking for a TV program. I was looking at the movie ads.
2024-04-04 19:50 | You: I know, but I just happened to notice it. New York is playing Boston.
2024-04-04 19:51 | Person2: That must be good. I wouldn't mind watching that.
2024-04-04 19:52 | You: OK. Let's stay home. We can go to the cinema Friday.
2024-04-23 20:15 | Person2: Hey, how about we try going downtown to see a movie this weekend?
2024-04-23 20:17 | You: I don't know, the cost is still a concern for me. Is there nothing good playing closer to home?
2024-04-23 20:19 | Person2: Well, let me take another look at the neighborhood options. Hmm, not seeing anything super appealing right now.
2024-04-23 20:22 | You: That's what I was afraid of. Maybe we should just hold off on the cinema for now and do something else instead?
2024-04-23 20:24 | Person2: Alright, no problem. We can revisit the movie idea another time when we find something that fits our budget better.
2024-06-13 19:05 | You: So, I was looking through the movie listings again and saw there's a good one playing at the Center Theater this weekend.
2024-06-13 19:08 | Person2: Oh yeah? What's it about?
2024-06-13 19:10 | You: It's supposed to be a pretty good thriller. But I'm not sure if it's our kind of thing.
2024-06-13 19:12 | Person2: Hmm, I don't know. Thrillers can be hit or miss for me. Maybe we should just stick to our usual TV night instead?
2024-06-13 19:14 | You: Yeah, probably a good call. We can try the cinema again another time when we find something we're both really excited about.
2024-06-13 19:16 | Person2: Sounds good to me. Movie night at home it is!
    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with [Person2] over the past few months regarding going to the movies. Back in early April, you were tired of watching TV and wanted to go to the cinema, but you two couldn't agree on a good neighborhood option that wouldn't cost too much. You ended up deciding to just stay home and watch a baseball game on TV instead. 

A few weeks later in late April, you brought up going to the movies again, and this time [Person2] suggested trying a downtown theater. However, you were still hesitant about the cost. After some back-and-forth, you decided to hold off and try to find a more affordable option closer to home. 

Just last week in mid-June, the topic came up once more. This time, you noticed a promising movie listed in the neighborhood theater guide, but [Person2] wasn't convinced it would be a good fit. Ultimately, you agreed to just stay in and watch TV again, with a plan to revisit the cinema idea in the near future.

Throughout these conversations, it's been clear that finding an affordable, convenient movie option that you both enjoy has been an ongoing challenge. But I'm glad you've been open to compromising and trying to find a solution that works for both of you. Hopefully you can find the right movie night soon!
