[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with John over the past few months regarding the data entry position:

Back in early February, you initially interviewed John for the data entry role. He impressed you with his 3 years of relevant experience and familiarity with programming languages. While he lacked knowledge of processing management information, he expressed confidence in his ability to learn quickly. 

A couple weeks later in mid-February, you followed up to inform John that he was a top candidate and to request references. In early March, after a brief reference check, you offered him the position, which he enthusiastically accepted. John started in the role later that month.

Throughout April and May, you checked in periodically with John to see how he was acclimating. He shared that he was enjoying the work but had encountered some challenges with the management information system. You offered guidance and encouraged him to keep learning. By late May, John reported feeling much more comfortable with those duties.

Earlier this month in June, you met with John for his 90-day review. He expressed appreciation for your support and mentorship. You commended his strong performance and quick mastery of new skills. As of today, June 14th, John has become a valued member of the data entry team, consistently demonstrating the aptitude and drive he displayed in your initial interview.
