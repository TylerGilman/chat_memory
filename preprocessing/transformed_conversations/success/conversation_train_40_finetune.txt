    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with Person2 over the past few months. Back in early May, you had just bought a new dress and were planning to wear it for a talk at your school. Person2 complimented how great you looked in the dress and asked if you were going to a job interview or a party. You explained that it was for a speaking engagement at your school, and you mentioned that you got a good deal on the dress, saving $30 off the original price. 

A few weeks later in late May, you followed up with Person2 about what they had been up to while you were out shopping. They shared that they had spent the day relaxing at home - watching TV, reading a boring book, and taking a shower. You then recalled that Person2 had mentioned plans to visit your friend Mike, who had recently returned home after an accident.

Just last week in late June, you and Person2 discussed the situation with your friend Mike in more detail. You expressed your gladness that he was finally able to come back home, and it seems the accident he was involved in has now been resolved. This conversation provided helpful closure on that important personal matter.

Overall, these interactions show the progression of your shopping trip, your friend's recovery, and the casual day-to-day activities you and Person2 engaged in over the past few months. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
