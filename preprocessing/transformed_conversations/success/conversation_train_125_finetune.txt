[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with the customer who booked a taxi to the airport back in late May. The initial call came in on May 25th, about three months ago, when they reserved a taxi for 7am on Saturday, May 27th for 3 passengers from the Garden Hotel to the airport at a fare of $60 total. 

You followed up the next day on May 26th to reconfirm all the details. Then on the morning of the 27th, your driver let you know they had picked up the passengers on time and the trip went smoothly.

About a month later in late June, the same customer called again to book a return taxi from the airport. You arranged their pickup for June 30th and it seems that trip also went off without a hitch.

So in the span of just over a month, you had a new customer book two taxi trips with you - an outbound to the airport in late May, and then a return trip from the airport in late June. Sounds like you provided great service and earned a repeat customer! Let me know if you need anything else.
