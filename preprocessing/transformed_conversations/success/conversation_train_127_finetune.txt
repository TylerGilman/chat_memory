[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Jane regarding the computer center job opportunity:

Back in early May, you first let Jane know about the summer website assistant positions that the computer center was looking to fill. She expressed interest despite limited experience. A few days later, Jane followed up asking for more details on the role which you provided, noting the focus on updating content and no coding required. By mid-May, Jane excitedly shared that she got an interview scheduled. At the end of the month, great news - she landed the job and was thrilled to have a productive summer gig that would build relevant skills. Finally, just last week, Jane messaged you to say the job has been going really well and thank you again for recommending her. She's learning a ton and contributing meaningfully to improving the school's site. Overall, it's been rewarding for you to see Jane pursue this opportunity that you initially flagged, and to know that your recommendation helped her secure a valuable summer position. Seems like it's been an ideal fit on both sides.
