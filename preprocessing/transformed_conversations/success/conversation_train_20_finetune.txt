    2024-06-07 10:23 | You: How do you put this seat back? I know there is a lever somewhere.
2024-06-07 10:24 | Person2: What are you doing?
2024-06-07 10:25 | You: I'm getting dressed, what does it look like?
2024-06-07 10:26 | Person2: It looks like you are about to get dressed. Did you forget we are in a car on the road?
2024-06-07 10:27 | You: I'm good at this. Nobody will see anything.
2024-06-07 10:28 | Person2: Are you kidding? You're going to cause an accident just from people gawking!
2024-06-07 10:29 | You: All right, pull over at that service station and I'll dress in the ladies'room.
2024-06-07 10:30 | Person2: That will be my pleasure.
2024-06-21 15:02 | Person2: Remember last time when you tried to get dressed in the car? We really can't do that.
2024-06-21 15:04 | You: I know, but it's just so much more convenient. I'm in a hurry and no one will notice.
2024-06-21 15:06 | Person2: It's not worth the risk. Let's find a proper place to stop so you can change safely.
2024-06-21 15:08 | You: Ugh, fine. There's a rest area up ahead, we can pull over there.
2024-08-02 09:17 | You: I need to get changed before we get to the event. Can I just do it quickly here?
2024-08-02 09:19 | Person2: Absolutely not. We talked about this before, it's not safe or appropriate to get dressed in the car. Let's find a restroom or changing area.
2024-08-02 09:21 | You: But it will only take a minute, no one will see anything!
2024-08-02 09:23 | Person2: I'm not budging on this. Your safety and comfort are more important than a little extra time. We're pulling over at the next place we see.
2024-08-02 09:25 | You: Ugh, fine. I guess you're right, as usual.
    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with Person2 over the past few months. Back in early June, you were getting dressed in the car and Person2 warned you about the risks of causing an accident. You ended up agreeing to pull over at a service station so you could change in the ladies' room instead. A few weeks later in late June, you two discussed a similar situation where you wanted to get dressed discreetly, and Person2 again cautioned against it. Just last week in early August, the same issue came up, and this time Person2 was more insistent that you find a proper place to change. It seems this has become an ongoing point of contention between you, with Person2 concerned for your safety and your desire for privacy and convenience. The progression shows how this has become a recurring challenge that you'll need to find a long-term solution for.
