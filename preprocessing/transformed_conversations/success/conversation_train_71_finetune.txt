[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Mr. Johnson regarding his suite reservation, from your perspective as the hotel reservation agent:

The first time Mr. Johnson called to book a duplex suite was on March 15th, about two months ago. Unfortunately, we were overbooked for his requested date and couldn't accommodate him directly. However, you took the initiative to find availability at the nearby Holiday Inn and provided their contact details. 

Mr. Johnson called back the next day to thank you for the helpful referral. Then in mid-April, he reached out again, sharing that his plans had changed and he was hoping to book with us after all, if anything had opened up. You were pleased to inform him that a cancellation had made a duplex suite available, and you helped him secure the reservation he originally wanted.

In early May, Mr. Johnson proactively messaged to reconfirm all the details and check on the cancellation policy, in case his trip dates shifted. You promptly responded to assure him that his suite was guaranteed and provided the requested policy information. 

Just last week, he sent a quick note to let you know how much he appreciated your attentive service throughout the booking process. Helping a guest navigate from an overbooked situation to an ideal reservation was very rewarding, and you look forward to ensuring Mr. Johnson has an excellent stay next month.
