2024-05-06 13:24 | John: Hey man, you won't believe what happened. I put a buck in the vending machine for a 75 cent candy bar and it got stuck! I hit the change button and nothing came out. This dumb machine owes me a quarter.
2024-05-06 13:26 | You: Oh man, that sucks. Did you try talking to someone at the snack bar to see if they can refund you?
2024-05-06 13:27 | John: Yeah I asked but the guy said he doesn't own the machines. Apparently I have to call some number on it.
2024-05-06 13:28 | You: What a hassle. Well I guess it's worth a shot.
2024-05-06 13:30 | John: I had an idea - why don't we just rock the machine back and forth until the candy bar falls out? I've done it before.
2024-05-06 13:32 | You: No way, I'm not risking breaking it! Knowing our luck someone would call the cops on us.
2024-05-06 13:33 | John: Yeah you're probably right. Oh well. The machine and I hit it off earlier so at least I scored a free candy bar out of it. Want it?
2024-05-06 13:34 | You: Haha sure, thanks man. Hope you have better luck next time!
2024-05-22 12:02 | John: Ugh, that stupid vending machine ate my money again today.
2024-05-22 12:05 | You: Seriously? You'd think they'd have fixed it by now. Maybe you should put an "out of order" sign on it lol
2024-05-22 12:06 | John: I'm about to! Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...
2024-05-22 12:07 | You: Did you ever end up calling that number to report it?
2024-05-22 12:10 | John: Not yet, been too busy. I'll get around to it one of these days.
2024-05-22 12:11 | You: Well good luck. Hope you get your money back and then some!
2024-06-14 17:45 | John: Whew, finally got a chance to call the vending machine company today and give them an earful.
2024-06-14 17:50 | You: Nice! How'd it go? Are they gonna fix it?
2024-06-14 17:52 | John: The lady said she'd send someone out to look at it but who knows when. I'm not holding my breath.
2024-06-14 17:53 | You: Well at least you reported it. Definitely follow up if you don't hear back soon!
2024-06-14 17:54 | John: Oh I will. They haven't heard the last from me!
2024-07-10 10:15 | John: Dude, great news! I got to work today and saw a repair guy working on the vending machine!
2024-07-10 10:17 | You: No way, they actually came? About time!
2024-07-10 10:18 | John: Right? The repair guy gave me a few free snacks too for "my troubles". I call that a win.
2024-07-10 10:20 | You: Heck yeah, you earned it after all that hassle. Glad they finally resolved it!
2024-07-10 10:21 | John: You and me both. Persistence pays off I guess! Thanks for letting me vent to you about it btw.
2024-07-10 10:23 | You: Anytime man, that's what friends are for. Proud of you for sticking with it!
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with John over the past couple months regarding the vending machine incident. It all started back in early May when John first told you about losing money in the vending machine at work. You tried to help by suggesting he talk to someone to get a refund, but he ended up just taking a candy bar that the machine gave him earlier. 

A few weeks later in late May, John mentioned that the vending machine was still acting up and eating people's money. You joked about putting an "out of order" sign on it. Then in mid-June, John said he finally called the number on the machine to report the issues, but hadn't heard back. You commiserated and suggested following up.

Earlier this month, John excitedly told you that the vending machine company finally came to repair the machine and even gave him a few free snacks for the trouble. You congratulated him on his persistence in getting it resolved. And just last week, John thanked you for your advice and support through the whole ordeal. It was a silly situation, but you were glad you could help in some small way. All's well that ends well!
