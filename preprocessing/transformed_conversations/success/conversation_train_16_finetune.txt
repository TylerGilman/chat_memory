[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Alex over the past few months regarding Valentine's Day. It all started back in early February when you asked Alex about their Valentine's Day traditions. They explained how boys usually give roses and girls give chocolate in return, which you found quite romantic. 

A couple weeks later in mid-February, you followed up to ask how Alex's Valentine's Day went. They excitedly shared that their crush had given them a beautiful bouquet of red roses, making them feel special and appreciated. In early March, you messaged again to see if anything had developed with Alex's crush. They revealed that they had gone on a wonderful first date together and really hit it off.

Then in mid-April, about a month ago, Alex reached out to you for some relationship advice. Things had been going well with their boyfriend, but Alex was feeling anxious about an upcoming couples' trip they had planned. You reassured Alex that some nerves are normal and encouraged them to focus on enjoying quality time together. 

Finally, just last week, Alex sent you photos from their trip, showing what an amazing time they had. The experience brought them much closer as a couple. Looking back, it's amazing to see Alex's journey from single on Valentine's Day to being in a blossoming relationship today, and you've enjoyed being a supportive friend along the way as Alex navigated the joys and challenges of young love.
