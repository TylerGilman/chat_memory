    [CHAT MESSAGES]
    2024-06-14 15:22 | You: Next week is your birthday party. How exciting! What do you want for your birthday?
2024-06-14 15:24 | [Person2]: Well, a car like yours would be fantastic.
2024-06-14 15:25 | You: Hmm...Maybe not a car just yet. You're only turning 9, you know? How about a doll?
2024-06-14 15:27 | [Person2]: Mom, I'm a boy. Boys don't play with stupid dolls, but a machine gun would be OK, too.
2024-06-14 15:29 | You: Well, not this time. Maybe we could get you a nice dress and a little purse, son. Maybe...
2024-06-14 15:31 | [Person2]: Maybe I should change my name to Mary since you seem to want a daughter so badly?
2024-07-21 11:02 | [Person2]: Mom, I've been thinking about my birthday again. Can we go look at some cool action figures or video games instead of girly stuff?
2024-07-21 11:05 | You: I understand you don't want anything too "girly", but let's keep an open mind. How about we go to the toy store this weekend and you can show me some options you're interested in?
2024-07-21 11:08 | [Person2]: Fine, I guess. But no dolls or purses, ok?
2024-07-21 11:10 | You: Deal. I'm sure we can find something awesome that you'll love.
2024-08-30 17:42 | [Person2]: Mom, my birthday is coming up soon and I still don't have a present. Can we go look at the new machine guns they have at the sporting goods store?
2024-08-30 17:45 | You: *sigh* We've been over this, [Person2]. A machine gun is absolutely not an appropriate gift for a 9-year-old. How about we look at some cool Lego sets or video games instead?
2024-08-30 17:48 | [Person2]: But Mooooom! All the other kids are going to have way cooler presents than me.
2024-08-30 17:51 | You: I know you want something exciting, but safety has to come first. Let's focus on finding a gift you'll really enjoy playing with, okay?
2024-09-05 14:19 | You: I think I may have found the perfect birthday present for you. Want to take a look?
2024-09-05 14:21 | [Person2]: I guess, but it better not be another stupid doll.
2024-09-05 14:23 | You: No dolls, I promise. Just wait until you see it!
    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with [Person2] over the past several months leading up to their 9th birthday. Back in June, you were excited to plan for their upcoming birthday party and asked what kind of gift they would like. At the time, they expressed interest in a car like yours, which you gently shut down given their young age. Instead, you suggested the idea of a doll, which [Person2] firmly rejected as being too "girly" for a boy. The conversation then took an unexpected turn, with [Person2] even proposing to change their name to "Mary" since you seemed to want a daughter. 

Over the summer, the birthday gift discussions continued, with you trying to steer [Person2] towards more age-appropriate and gender-neutral options. However, they remained adamant about not wanting anything "sissy" and even suggested a machine gun as an alternative. It's been a challenging situation, but I'm glad we're now just a few weeks away from the party. Hopefully we can find a gift that [Person2] will genuinely enjoy without the back-and-forth. I appreciate you keeping me involved in the process and look forward to celebrating with the family soon.
