    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with Person2 over the past few months. About three months ago in early April, you confronted Person2 about not telling you they had a girlfriend. They apologized and acknowledged they should have mentioned it earlier. A few weeks later in late April, you pressed them further, upset that they didn't even tell you they were in love or planning to marry this person. Person2 seemed surprised, saying they didn't think it was that important to share. Just last week in early July, you finally exploded, angry that they never bothered to inform you about their impending marriage. Throughout these exchanges, you've expressed frustration at Person2's lack of transparency and communication, feeling they should have kept you better informed about this major life development.
