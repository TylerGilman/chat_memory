2024-04-05 23:17 | You: It's all good. I'll show you all the right moves. My name's Malik.
2024-04-05 23:18 | Wen: Nice to meet you. I'm Wen, and this is Nikki.
2024-04-05 23:19 | You: How you feeling', vista? Mind if I take your friend'round the dance floor?
2024-04-05 23:20 | Wen: She doesn't mind if you don't mind getting your feet stepped on.
2024-04-05 23:21 | You: Right. Cool! Let's go!
2024-04-12 20:42 | You: Hey Nikki, had a great time with you the other night. Would you be up for grabbing dinner this weekend?
2024-04-12 20:45 | Nikki: Hey Malik, that sounds fun! I'd love to. How about Saturday night?
2024-04-12 20:47 | You: Saturday works perfectly. I'll pick you up at 7?
2024-04-12 20:49 | Nikki: Sounds good, see you then!
2024-06-28 16:23 | Wen: Hi Malik, I wanted to check in about you and Nikki. She's been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately with how quickly things have been moving between you two. I know you really like her, but could you maybe pump the brakes a little and make sure you're both on the same page?
2024-06-28 16:27 | You: Oh, I see. I didn't realize Nikki was feeling that way. I really care about her and don't want to push her too hard. Maybe we can all grab coffee soon and talk through it?
2024-06-28 16:30 | Wen: That's a great idea. I'll let Nikki know. I'm sure if you two communicate openly, you can figure out the right pace for your relationship.
2024-06-28 16:32 | You: Sounds good, thanks Wen. I appreciate you looking out for your friend.
    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with Wen and Nikki over the past few months. Back in early April, you first met them at a club and charmed Nikki into dancing with you, even though she was hesitant at first. You two seemed to hit it off, and over the next few weeks, you continued messaging and making plans to see each other again. Three months ago in late June, you took Nikki on a proper date, and it seemed like things were progressing nicely between you two. However, just last week, Wen reached out with some concerns - apparently Nikki had been feeling a bit overwhelmed by the pace of your relationship. It's clear there's still mutual interest, but you may need to have an open conversation to get on the same page about where things are headed. I'd suggest taking things slow and making sure you're both comfortable with the direction of your connection.
