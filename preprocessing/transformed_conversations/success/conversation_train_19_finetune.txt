    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with Dave over the past few months. Back in early April, you initially invited Dave to come work with your team, and he was receptive to the idea, even joking about using his "green pad" to write you admiring notes. You two negotiated the terms, and Dave ultimately agreed to join your company, with the plan for him to start as soon as possible. 

Over the next several weeks, you two continued discussing the logistics and Dave's start date. It was clear he was excited about the opportunity and eager to get started. Then, about a month ago in mid-June, Dave reached out to confirm his start date and get some final details worked out. You were pleased to welcome him onboard and told him you'd be waiting for him to arrive.

Now, here we are in mid-July, and I'm sure you're looking forward to having Dave officially join the team and see what you can accomplish together. This seems like a great professional opportunity for both of you, and I'm glad you were able to come to an agreement that works for everyone. Let me know if you need anything else!
