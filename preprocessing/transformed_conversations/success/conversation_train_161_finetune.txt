2024-06-12 14:32 | You: You say he was around average height.
2024-06-12 14:33 | Witness: Yes, that's right, around five nine five ten.
2024-06-12 14:33 | You: Weight?
2024-06-12 14:34 | Witness: I'm not sure. Medium I suppose. Maybe a little on the heavy side.
2024-06-12 14:35 | You: Any marks on his face?
2024-06-12 14:35 | Witness: No, I don't think so.
2024-06-12 14:35 | You: Glasses?
2024-06-12 14:36 | Witness: No.
2024-06-12 14:37 | You: What about his hair?
2024-06-12 14:37 | Witness: Black or dark brown.
2024-06-12 14:38 | You: Long or short? Straight? Curly?
2024-06-12 14:39 | Witness: Straight, I think, and about average length
2024-06-12 14:40 | You: Boy, this sure doesn't help us much. It could be anybody. How about his clothes? What was he wearing?
2024-06-19 10:15 | You: Hey, I wanted to follow up and see if you remembered any other details about what the suspect was wearing? Anything beyond the generic description could help.
2024-06-19 10:47 | Witness: I've been trying to picture it... I think he had on a dark colored jacket, probably black or navy blue. That's about all that's coming to mind, sorry.
2024-06-19 10:52 | You: No worries, thanks for trying. Let me know if anything else comes back to you.
2024-07-08 16:22 | You: I know it's been a few weeks, but I wanted to check once more - any chance you've recalled any other details about the suspect's appearance? Even something minor could help trigger a lead.
2024-07-08 16:39 | Witness: You know, I keep getting this vague impression he may have had some facial hair...not clean shaven. Maybe a short beard or goatee? I can't say for sure though, it's hazy.
2024-07-08 16:44 | You: Interesting, that actually helps refine the description. Thanks for wracking your brain on this. I'll let you know if we turn up any matches to that profile.
2024-08-06 11:08 | You: I've got a set of mugshots here of individuals with some facial hair who roughly match the height/weight and are known to frequent the area. Take a look and let me know if any resemble the guy you saw.
2024-08-06 11:12 | You: [sends mugshot attachment]
2024-08-06 11:28 | Witness: These two in the middle row, #3 and #5, have the closest resemblance to what I remember. The beards look similar. But I really can't be certain it was either of them. It's still a bit of a blur. I don't want to accuse the wrong person.
2024-08-06 11:32 | You: I understand, this is helpful though. We'll see if we can place either of them near the scene. Thanks again, I know this hasn't been easy. We'll keep working on it.
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with the witness over the past couple months regarding the suspect's description:

Back in mid-June, you had an initial conversation with the witness where he provided a vague physical description of the suspect - average height and weight, dark hair, no distinguishing features. Feeling this was too generic to be useful, you followed up a week later asking for more details on the suspect's clothing, but the witness couldn't remember many specifics beyond a dark jacket. 

In early July, about three weeks after the first discussion, you circled back to ask if any additional details had come to mind. The witness mentioned the suspect may have had facial hair, either a beard or goatee, but he still seemed unsure. Hoping to jog his memory, last week you shared a series of mugshots to see if any looked familiar. The witness tentatively pointed out two that resembled the suspect, both with short beards, but he couldn't say for certain.

While the witness has been cooperative, the lack of a clear, confident identification means the investigation still lacks a solid lead as of today, August 15th. The incremental details about facial hair and the mugshot "maybes" provide a bit more to go on than the initial generic description, but unless the witness's memory is refreshed with new information, this lead may have reached a dead end after 2 months of effort. It may be time to explore other avenues to identify and locate the suspect.
