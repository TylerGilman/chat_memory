[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with the shoe store customer over the past couple months: 

Back in mid-June, about two months ago, you helped the customer find a pair of size 11 black shoes that he really liked. He bought them for $50. Then a few weeks later in early July, he came back to exchange them for a larger size since they were a bit snug. You helped him find a size 12 that fit much better.

Later in July, the customer returned again, this time looking for some dress shoes to wear to a wedding. You showed him several options and he chose a nice brown leather pair. He appreciated your helpful service and mentioned the wedding was in a month.

Just last week, the customer stopped by to thank you for your assistance. The wedding went great and he got many compliments on the shoes. He said he'll definitely be a regular customer from now on and will recommend your store to friends. 

Overall, you provided consistently excellent service over multiple visits, building a good relationship with a very satisfied customer. Great job!
