2024-04-05 19:37 | You: Here you are. A very special merlot brought directly from my home country. It has a unique ingredient which gives it a pleasant aroma and superior flavor

2024-04-05 19:43 | Ellen's friend: Yeah. . .
2024-04-05 19:44 | You: I hope that you didn't poison her drink too much! You'll ruin our meal!
2024-04-15 14:03 | You: Hi Ellen, just wanted to check in and see how you were feeling after the other night. I hope you're doing okay.
2024-04-15 16:27 | Ellen: Hey Armand. I'm alright, thanks for checking. Still feeling a bit groggy but I'm sure it'll pass. The wine really did a number on me!
2024-05-03 11:15 | You: Ellen, I found a lovely Gothic mirror that would be perfect for your foyer. Let me know if you'd like me to pick it up for you.
2024-05-03 13:41 | Ellen: Oh that's thoughtful of you Armand, but I think I'm going to hold off on redecorating for now. Still not 100% after that dinner. Talk soon.
2024-05-28 20:09 | Ellen's friend: Hi Armand. I've been thinking more about that night at your place and I have to ask - what exactly was in that "special" wine you served? Ellen hasn't been herself since then.
2024-05-28 23:17 | You: As I mentioned, it was a rare vintage with an ingredient native to my home country. I'm sorry to hear Ellen is still feeling unwell. Perhaps she had a bad reaction. I assure you it was not my intent.
2024-06-11 17:32 | Ellen's friend: I'm not buying it, Armand. Ellen's symptoms seem more consistent with some kind of drug than a food sensitivity. What are you not telling us?
2024-06-11 18:02 | You: I'm offended by what you're implying. I would never drug a guest. I've told you what I know about the wine. If Ellen is still ill, perhaps she should see a doctor instead of making baseless accusations.
2024-06-25 13:47 | Ellen's friend: We need to talk, Armand. Meet us at the cafe on Main St at 3pm.
2024-06-25 13:49 | You: I have no idea what this is about but fine, I'll be there.
2024-06-25 15:12 | You: I don't appreciate being ambushed like this. If you have something to say, come out and say it.
2024-06-25 15:14 | Ellen: We know you drugged me that night, Armand. I've been piecing it together for weeks. How could you do this? I thought we were friends!
2024-06-25 15:15 | You: This is ludicrous. I did no such thing and I resent these slanderous accusations. I'm leaving.
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Ellen and her friend over the past few months, Armand. It all started back in early April when they first came over for dinner at your place. The evening took an unexpected turn when Ellen passed out after drinking the special wine you served. Her friend seemed concerned but you were mostly worried about the meal being ruined. 

In the following weeks, you checked in with them a couple times. Ellen said she was feeling better but something seemed off. In late May, her friend reached out expressing some suspicions about that night and your "special ingredient." The tone grew more accusatory in your exchanges in June, culminating in a heated confrontation at a cafe three weeks ago where they directly accused you of drugging Ellen. You've maintained your innocence but the damage to your relationship seems irreparable at this point. No further contact since then. Let me know if you need anything else!
