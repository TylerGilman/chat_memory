    [SUMMARY]
    Here's a summary of your interactions with Ellen and [Person3] over the past few months. About six weeks ago in early May, you hosted them for a dinner party at your home. The evening started off well, with you offering them a glass of your special merlot wine. However, things took an unexpected turn when Ellen mentioned the wine tasting a bit bitter to her. Shortly after, she unexpectedly passed out. You expressed concern about potentially having poisoned her drink, worried that it would ruin the meal. 

This incident has clearly raised some red flags. Based on the progression of events, it seems there may be more to the story than meets the eye. A few weeks prior in late April, you had a private discussion with [Person3] about potentially redecorating their home and offering your design expertise. This suggests you may have been trying to cultivate a closer relationship with them. And the fact that Ellen reacted so strongly to the wine raises questions about whether it was intentionally tampered with.

I would encourage you to reflect carefully on these interactions and consider the motivations and potential risks involved. While the dinner party may have seemed harmless on the surface, the unexpected turn of events indicates there could be deeper issues at play. Moving forward, it would be wise to approach any further interactions with Ellen and [Person3] with an abundance of caution and transparency. The wellbeing and trust of your guests should be the top priority.
