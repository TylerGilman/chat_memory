2024-04-03 07:45 | Edward: Why are you so excited, Edward? Is there anything happy?
2024-04-03 07:46 | You: Of course. Not only happy, but also meaningful. I took the subway to school this morning. In the subway station, I saw one novel lying on a seat there and another near the elevator.
2024-04-03 07:48 | Edward: Really? They must have been put there by someone for sharing.
2024-04-03 07:50 | You: Yes, I was curious in red one. What a good way to kill time on the way. I plan to put my book there, too. Just for sharing.
2024-04-03 07:52 | Edward: Great. But please, place it in a proper place and don't bother the traffic.
2024-04-03 07:53 | You: OK, I will.
2024-04-10 18:22 | You: Remember that book I left on the subway last week? I saw someone reading it today during my commute! It made me so happy to see it being enjoyed.
2024-04-10 18:30 | Edward: That's wonderful! I'm glad your book sharing idea is brightening people's rides. As long as they are placed responsibly, a few subway books seem like a lovely addition.
2024-05-02 12:11 | Edward: How's the subway library going? Are people still leaving and borrowing books?
2024-05-02 12:15 | You: It's really taken off! There are usually 4-5 books to choose from now on any given day. I love seeing which new titles appear.
2024-05-02 12:17 | Edward: That's quite a selection! You've started a delightful trend. Thanks for bringing more reading into people's lives.
2024-05-23 21:02 | You: I need your advice... Someone complained to the station manager that the books are starting to get in the way and create clutter. I feel terrible but I'm not sure what to do.
2024-05-23 21:10 | Edward: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Hmm, what if you suggested designating one specific shelf or spot for the book exchange? That way they are contained but still available.
2024-05-23 21:14 | You: That's a great idea! I'll talk to the manager about setting aside an official book corner. Hopefully that solves the issue. Thanks for your help!
2024-05-23 21:16 | Edward: Anytime! Let me know how it goes. I'm crossing my fingers the book share can continue one way or another.
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Edward over the past few months regarding book sharing on the subway. It all started back in early April when Edward first excitedly told you about seeing books left on the subway for people to read. You thought it was a nice idea for sharing but reminded him to be mindful of placement. A week later, Edward messaged you saying he left one of his own books and noticed someone reading it, which made him happy. In early May, you asked for an update and he said the book sharing had really taken off, with multiple books always available now. However, later that month, Edward ran into an issue with someone complaining that the books were getting in the way. After discussing it with you, he came up with the solution of designating a specific shelf for the book exchange to keep things orderly. Now, as of today, the subway book share is still going strong after 2.5 months and has grown quite popular. Edward seems very fulfilled to have started this positive initiative that is bringing joy to other passengers.
