    2024-04-05 15:22 | You: Excuse me, where is the airport?
2024-04-05 15:24 | Person2: Um, it's pretty far away. I can show you on the map on my smart phone.
2024-04-05 15:25 | You: Oh, sorry, and what I meant is how can I get there?
2024-04-05 15:27 | Person2: Well, that depends. Do you want to get there quickly or cheaply?
2024-04-05 15:29 | You: Probably the latter would be better.
2024-04-05 15:31 | Person2: All right. If you go down one block and take a left, you'll see the number 12 subway station. Take the number 12 all the way to Grove Street. And then transferred to the airport express' train.
2024-04-25 10:42 | You: Hi Person2, I wanted to double-check the directions you gave me for getting to the airport. Can you please confirm the steps again?
2024-04-25 10:45 | Person2: Sure, no problem. Go down one block and take a left to the number 12 subway station. Ride the number 12 all the way to Grove Street, then transfer to the airport express train. The announcements on the trains will let you know when to make the switch.
2024-04-25 10:47 | You: Great, thanks so much. I want to make sure I have it right before my trip next week.
2024-04-25 10:49 | Person2: Absolutely, I'm happy to clarify. Just follow the signs and the other passengers and you'll be at the airport in no time.
2024-06-15 18:02 | You: Hi Person2, I wanted to let you know that the directions you provided for getting to the airport worked out perfectly. Thanks again for your help, it made my trip so much easier!
2024-06-15 18:05 | Person2: Oh, I'm so glad to hear that! I'm really happy the route I suggested worked well for you. Safe travels and let me know if you need any other local tips in the future.
