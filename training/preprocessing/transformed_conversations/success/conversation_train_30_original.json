    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the customer over the past few months... Back in early May, they came into the restaurant and you took their initial order for drinks, a steak dinner, and dessert. A week later, they returned and complimented the great service and food from their first visit. You got to know them a bit more personally. In mid-June, there was an issue with their takeout order being incorrect, but you handled it gracefully and provided a refund, which they greatly appreciated. Earlier this summer in July, they came in to celebrate a special occasion and you went above and beyond to make it a wonderful experience. And just last week, they stopped by to let you know they are moving away but wanted to thank you for the consistently stellar service over the past few months. It's been a pleasure getting to know this customer and ensuring they had positive experiences at the restaurant.",
