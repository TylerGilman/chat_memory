    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the salesperson regarding the laptop gift for your daughter: \nBack in mid-January, about 3 months ago, you visited the store looking for a gift for your daughter. The salesperson recommended a MacBook Pro which you purchased that same day using your Visa card. A week later, your daughter was thrilled with the gift when she received it for her birthday. However, in early February you contacted the store again because your daughter was having some technical issues setting up the laptop. The salesperson walked you through some troubleshooting steps which resolved the problem. Then last month, in mid-March, you returned to the store and purchased a laptop case and some software your daughter needed for school, with the same helpful salesperson assisting you. Overall, despite the small technical hiccup, the MacBook Pro has been an excellent gift that your daughter has been using daily for school and personal use. The helpful service from this salesperson has given you confidence to return to them for your daughter's future computer needs.",
