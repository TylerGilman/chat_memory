    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the customer who rented the Porsche, going back to late May. About two months ago on May 25th, you assisted him with renting a Porsche and purchasing rental insurance at your office. He had asked about returning the car in San Francisco, but you had to inform him it could only be returned to your location. The next day, he messaged to say how much he was enjoying the car. Then in mid-June, about a month ago, he reached out because the car had broken down. You helped coordinate towing it to a repair shop. Last week, on July 10th, he returned to your office to settle the final bill, including the additional repair costs which were thankfully covered by the insurance he had purchased. Overall, despite the unexpected issue with the car, you were able to provide excellent customer service throughout the 7-week rental period and resolve the situation to the customer's satisfaction.",
