    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Jane over the past few months regarding dancing and your evolving relationship. It all started back in early May when you first invited her out dancing at a local nightclub. That evening, about 3 months ago now, you two hit it off on the dance floor, especially during the slow waltz songs Jane enjoyed. A couple weeks later in mid-May, you met up again and Jane opened up about her passion for dance. By early June, you were regularly going out dancing together and your relationship was blossoming. However, later that month Jane seemed more distant, canceling plans last-minute. After a heart-to-heart in early July where Jane shared some personal struggles, you supported her and your bond grew stronger. Just last week, you had a magical night out dancing again, feeling closer than ever after weathering those challenges. Looking back, what started as a simple dance invitation has transformed into a deep, caring relationship full of shared passion, memorable nights out, emotional growth, and strengthened trust. You've come a long way together in a short time and grown immensely close through your shared love of dance and supporting each other through life's ups and downs.",
