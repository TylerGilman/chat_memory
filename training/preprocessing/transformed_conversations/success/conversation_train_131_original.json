    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Joe over the past couple months regarding his dangerous experiences. It started back on April 12th when you asked Joe about his worst accident. He told you about crashing into a wall during last year's British Grand Prix, destroying his car and breaking his leg. A few weeks later on May 2nd, you followed up to see if that was his only brush with death. Surprisingly, he shared a more recent frightening experience - just driving through London traffic on his way to meet you that very day! The conversation lapsed for a while, but then earlier this week on June 14th, you checked in again. Joe opened up about how the accident still haunts him and affects his racing confidence. He's working with a sports psychologist but progress is slow. Overall, it's clear that despite Joe's bravado, his dangerous lifestyle takes a mental toll. Your periodic check-ins seem to provide a helpful outlet for him to process things.",
