    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Nancy regarding your car search over the past several months, Tom. It all started back in early February when you first mentioned needing a new car after your old one died. Nancy initially suggested looking at single seller listings and used cars. You were hesitant about inheriting someone else's problems. By late March, Nancy had convinced you to consider a new car given the easy financing available these days. In April and May, the two of you discussed makes and models as you narrowed down your preferences. A minor setback occurred in early June when the financing fell through, but by the end of July, you had secured a great loan and made a down payment on a sleek sedan that checked all your boxes. Just last week, you proudly showed off your new ride to Nancy. What a journey it's been!",
