    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the art teacher over the past few months. It all started back on March 12th when he came into the store to purchase some art supplies. You had a nice chat and learned he was a regular customer. Then about three weeks later, on April 2nd, he returned and you helped him select some specialty brushes he needed for a new project. In early May, around the 6th, he stopped by again to stock up on paints and mentioned his students were preparing pieces for an upcoming art show. Finally, just last week on June 11th, he came in looking for frames and shared that the art show had been a big success. Over these months, you've enjoyed getting to know him, hearing about his passion for teaching, and following the progress of his students' work.",
