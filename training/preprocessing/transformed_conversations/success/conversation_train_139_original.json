    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sarah over the past few months regarding relationships. It started back in early May when you asked about the guy she met at the bar. She wasn't sure about him at first, but you encouraged her not to judge too quickly, sharing how your own relationship took time to develop. As you opened up more in late May, Sarah shared about her last toxic relationship that ended with her ex cheating. You supported her decision to end it. In June, the topic shifted to your own dating life, with you expressing contentment with being single for now. By mid-July, Sarah revealed she decided to give the bar guy (Mark) a chance and they had been on a few great dates. However, just last week in early August, Sarah confided in you that Mark said he wasn't ready for commitment, leading to a tough conversation. Throughout this period, you provided a listening ear and advice when needed, strengthening your friendship.",
