    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the customer who opened a current account, based on our chat records. You first assisted them with opening the account and making an initial 3,000 yuan deposit on March 12th, about 2 months ago. The following week, they reached out again for help with setting up online banking access, which you walked them through. Then in mid-April, about a month ago, they contacted you because of some concerns about unauthorized charges. You helped them dispute the charges and issued them a new card as a precaution. Most recently, last Tuesday they visited your branch in-person to add their spouse as a joint account holder, which you facilitated. Throughout these interactions over the past couple months, you've provided attentive customer service to address their banking needs and resolve issues promptly, developing a positive relationship with this new customer.",
