    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Jamie over the past couple months regarding movie plans:\n\nBack in early June, you and Jamie first discussed going to see a movie together. You weren't too keen on the action-comedy Hot Fuzz that Jamie suggested, preferring something with a happier ending. You proposed seeing the Hollywood blockbuster You, Me and Dupree instead, but Jamie wasn't interested in that \"chick flick\". \n\nAfter some back and forth, you both agreed on the biographical drama Becoming Jane about Jane Austen, and made plans to meet up and see it a couple days later. The movie ended up being fantastic and sparked some great discussions between you.\n\nA few weeks after that in late June, Jamie reached out again to rave about how much they enjoyed Becoming Jane and spending time together. This led to more conversations about your shared love of period dramas and wanting to hang out more.\n\nIn mid-July, Jamie sadly had to cancel plans last-minute to go see another movie due to a family emergency. You were very understanding and rescheduled for the following weekend. \n\nThat brings us to last week, when you had an amazing time seeing the new film adaptation of Little Women together. You really appreciated Jamie's emotional support during the sad scenes. Afterwards at dinner, you bonded over relatable parts of the story and your hopes and dreams. \n\nOverall, your movie dates and deep talks have really strengthened your friendship with Jamie over the past couple months. Becoming Jane was the perfect choice that first time, sparking lots of meaningful conversations since. Despite the mid-July hiccup, you've grown a lot closer and seem to really \"get\" each other now. Excited to see where this friendship goes from here!",
