    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Alex over the past few months regarding dance and your developing friendship. It all started back in early February when you first hit it off at the disco, bonding over your shared love of fast dance music. You had a great time dancing together that night. \n\nIn the following weeks, you stayed in touch, chatting about various dance styles and making plans to go out dancing again. By early March, you started having deeper conversations, opening up more about your lives and interests beyond just dance. Alex shared some personal struggles in mid-March, which you offered support and encouragement about.\n\nAs spring progressed, you made good on your plans and met up regularly to practice dance techniques and enjoy each other's company. Your friendship really started to blossom. In late May, Alex excitedly told you about an upcoming dance competition in July and you agreed to be partners and enter it together. \n\nThe next month and a half was filled with intense practices as you worked hard to perfect your routine. Though it was sometimes stressful, preparing for the competition together strengthened your bond. When the big day arrived in mid-July, all your hard work paid off and you won second place! You were so proud of what you accomplished as a team.\n\nIn the month since then, you've celebrated your success and discussed future dance aspirations. You've also continued deepening your friendship, being there for each other through life's ups and downs. It's been a truly meaningful connection that started with a shared passion and has grown into a cherished friendship. As of today, you really appreciate how dance brought you together and the special bond you've formed over the past 6 months.",
