    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sarah over the past couple months regarding cooking and eating out:\n\nBack in early June, you and Sarah had a conversation about being hungry and whether to eat out or cook at home. You expressed being tired of restaurants after a bad experience at a new French place and eating out frequently the previous week. Despite Sarah not being in the mood to cook, you offered to make a home-cooked meal that day. \n\nA few days later in mid-June, Sarah thanked you for the delicious meal you made and suggested taking turns cooking for each other, which you happily agreed to. You enjoyed trading recipes and cooking tips over the next few weeks.\n\nHowever, by mid-July, you both got busier with work and found it harder to find time to cook. After a couple weeks of falling back on takeout, Sarah proposed setting aside dedicated time each Sunday to meal prep together for the week, which has worked out great for the past month. Just last weekend, you tried out an ambitious new recipe together that came out amazing.\n\nOverall, what started as a simple discussion about one meal turned into an ongoing collaboration over the past two months that has brought you closer together through a shared love of home cooking - while still indulging in the occasional restaurant treat! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
