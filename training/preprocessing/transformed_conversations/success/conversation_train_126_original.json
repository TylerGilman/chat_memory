    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Francisco over the past several months. You first met Pancho, as his friends call him, back in early February. He told you about his large family in Peru and how he's the second oldest of 14 kids. His father drives a taxi in Lima while his mother helps run the family store.\n\nA few weeks later in late February, Pancho mentioned his father was in a minor accident but thankfully wasn't injured. In April, Pancho shared the exciting news that his sister Maria got engaged. You sent your congratulations. \n\nIn May, Pancho seemed stressed about the store's finances. His family was considering taking out a loan to cover expenses. You offered some budgeting tips that seemed to help. By late June, things were looking up - Pancho said the store had its best month yet.\n\nLast month in July, Pancho invited you to his sister's wedding in Peru this December. You told him you'd love to come and started looking into flights and hotels. Just last week, Pancho filled you in on the latest wedding plans and said how much he's looking forward to you meeting his family in person after getting to know them through your chats. All in all, it's been really nice developing a friendship with Pancho and learning more about his life and family in Peru over these past 6 months. Meeting up at the wedding will be a great chance to celebrate together after supporting each other through the ups and downs of the year.",
