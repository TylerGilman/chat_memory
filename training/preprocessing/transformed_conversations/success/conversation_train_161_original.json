    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the witness over the past couple months regarding the suspect's description:\n\nBack in mid-June, you had an initial conversation with the witness where he provided a vague physical description of the suspect - average height and weight, dark hair, no distinguishing features. Feeling this was too generic to be useful, you followed up a week later asking for more details on the suspect's clothing, but the witness couldn't remember many specifics beyond a dark jacket. \n\nIn early July, about three weeks after the first discussion, you circled back to ask if any additional details had come to mind. The witness mentioned the suspect may have had facial hair, either a beard or goatee, but he still seemed unsure. Hoping to jog his memory, last week you shared a series of mugshots to see if any looked familiar. The witness tentatively pointed out two that resembled the suspect, both with short beards, but he couldn't say for certain.\n\nWhile the witness has been cooperative, the lack of a clear, confident identification means the investigation still lacks a solid lead as of today, August 15th. The incremental details about facial hair and the mugshot \"maybes\" provide a bit more to go on than the initial generic description, but unless the witness's memory is refreshed with new information, this lead may have reached a dead end after 2 months of effort. It may be time to explore other avenues to identify and locate the suspect.",
