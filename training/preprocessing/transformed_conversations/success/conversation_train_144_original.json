    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Samantha regarding the video project over the past few months. It started back in early April when you expressed disappointment with her friend Lenny's amateur videography work. Despite Samantha trying to defend him initially, she came around to agreeing the quality was subpar. \n\nIn mid-May, about a month later, Samantha reached out saying Lenny offered to re-edit the footage for free. You were skeptical but decided to give him another chance. However, by early June the revised edit still had many issues. Frustrated, you told Samantha you wanted to hire a professional editor to salvage the project.\n\nAfter getting quotes, in mid-June you and Samantha agreed to split the cost of hiring a pro editor. The professional delivered much higher quality work a few weeks later in early July. Relieved, you thanked Samantha for working with you to find a solution, even if it cost more than originally planned. She appreciated your patience and willingness to invest in doing it right.\n\nNow, in mid-July, you're both very happy with the final edited video. It's a huge improvement from Lenny's initial attempt back in the spring. While it was a long few months getting here, you're pleased with the end result and proud of the finished product. The experience taught you the importance of hiring skilled professionals from the start of creative projects.",
