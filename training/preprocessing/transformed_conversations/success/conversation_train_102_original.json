    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Susan regarding the Silk Company account, Todd. The situation first came to light on March 12th when Susan informed you out of the blue that she was taking over the account you had been working on for a month and a half. Apparently this decision was made the previous week without your knowledge while you were meeting with the client, Mr. Wei. \n\nOver the following weeks, you expressed your frustration to Susan and tried to get clarity on why the decision was made. In early April, about 3 weeks after first learning of the change, you had a lengthy discussion with Susan where she provided more context - apparently Mr. Emory, your boss, felt things were moving too slowly and wanted a \"fresh start\", but failed to inform you directly. While this provided some insight, you still felt slighted.\n\nAs spring progressed, you mostly moved on but the issue came up again in May when you were accidentally left off a key meeting invite regarding the Silk account. This resurfaced some of the earlier communication and process issues. You had a pointed conversation with Susan in late May where you re-emphasized the need for better communication and inclusion going forward.\n\nNow, in mid-July, the Silk account transition occurred over 4 months ago. While there are still occasional frustrations, you've mostly settled into the new normal and are focused on other accounts. Susan has made efforts to improve communication and keep you in the loop, but it remains an area for continued growth. Looking back, while the initial handling was far from ideal, you're doing your best to be professional and move forward productively.",
