    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sam over the past few months regarding their seaside trip. Back in early April, around 2024-04-03, Sam first mentioned their upcoming trip to the coast. You were excited to hear about it and asked them to share details afterwards. About a week later on 2024-04-11, Sam got back from the trip and filled you in on the scenic drive through the valley, stopping at the waterfall, and swimming in the sea. Their vivid descriptions made you feel like you were almost there. \n\nAs spring progressed, you checked in with Sam in early May to see if they had any photos to share from the trip. They sent over a few snapshots that captured the waterfall and coastline beautifully. Seeing the images brought the story to life even more. Finally, just last week around 2024-06-10, you and Sam were reflecting on fun memories from this year so far. The seaside trip came up again as a highlight, and you both expressed a desire to plan a similar getaway together sometime, maybe in the fall when the summer crowds die down. All in all, Sam's trip provided a recurring touchpoint in your conversations, adding color and shared aspirations to your friendship over these past three months.",
