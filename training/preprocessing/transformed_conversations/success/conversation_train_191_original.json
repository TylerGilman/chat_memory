    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Alex over the past couple months regarding your paper: \n\nBack in early May, you expressed feeling awful about your paper after missing the deadline, but Alex reassured you after reading it that you had done a good job applying general knowledge to specific problems. Alex did suggest being more concise and carefully editing out unimportant information. \n\nThen in mid-May, you reached out again for more detailed feedback. Alex provided constructive criticism on specific sections and gave helpful tips on refining your arguments. This seemed to boost your confidence.\n\nHowever, in early June you found out the paper would need to undergo a major revision and resubmission process due to the missed deadline. You vented your frustrations to Alex, who empathized but encouraged you to view it as an opportunity to further improve the work.\n\nAfter putting in significant effort on the revisions, last week you excitedly shared with Alex that the revised paper had been accepted. Alex congratulated you on the great news and all the hard work you put in. Looking back, Alex's support and advice played a key role in helping you navigate this challenging but ultimately successful process with your paper.",
