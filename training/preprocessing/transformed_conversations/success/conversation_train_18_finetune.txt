[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Alex over the past few months regarding your shared love of ice cream and some of the more interesting flavors and experiences you've discussed:

It all started back on March 15th when you two first bonded over your favorite ice cream flavors while perusing the huge selection at a local shop. In the following weeks, you texted back and forth a few times to share ice cream recommendations. Then in mid-April, Alex tried an unusual garlic ice cream that sounded absolutely revolting to you. As spring turned to summer, you met up again in person and Alex shared photos from the garlic ice cream experience, which looked as awful as it sounded. In June, you excitedly told Alex about an amazing chocolate hazelnut gelato you discovered. Last month in July, you two had a long phone chat catching up about your summer adventures and Alex mentioned finding a great new ice cream spot to try together soon. Just last week, you texted to firm up plans to meet there this coming weekend to sample their unique flavors. It's been really fun bonding with Alex over the past 5 months through your mutual love of ice cream (minus the garlic incident). Trying out new places and flavors together has become a nice tradition in your friendship.
