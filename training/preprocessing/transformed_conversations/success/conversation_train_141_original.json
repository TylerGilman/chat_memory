    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Xiao over the past several months. It all started back on January 15th when you two first met at the airport in London and bonded over your shared experience of a frustrating flight delay. Xiao mentioned being in Beijing for a space technology conference, while you had just gotten back from an exciting multi-city tour of China. \n\nIn the weeks that followed, you kept in touch, with Xiao checking in to see how you were doing in early February. By late March, Xiao shared the exciting news that the space agency was considering him for a promotion to Project Manager for an upcoming lunar mission. You offered hearty congratulations.\n\nHowever, in May, Xiao revealed that he was passed over for the promotion, much to his disappointment. You listened supportively as he processed the letdown. Determined to keep moving forward in his career, in July Xiao told you he had applied to several positions at other space agencies in Europe. After an intense round of interviews in August, just last week Xiao excitedly announced that he had accepted a dream job at the European Space Agency and would be moving to Germany in October. \n\nWhile bittersweet to see him leave China, you're thrilled that your friendship that started with a chance airport encounter has grown to span continents as you've supported each other through ups and downs. Xiao's resilience and passion for his field have inspired you. As he embarks on this exciting new chapter, you look forward to seeing where his career takes him next, and to many more thoughtful conversations, even if they end up being more remote than those early in-person chats.",
