    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with your friend regarding his breakup, as recorded in our conversation history. It started back in early April when you first noticed he seemed upset and he confided in you that his girlfriend had broken up with him, even though he loved her. You comforted him and suggested maybe trying to talk to her again. \n\nA week later in mid-April, he shared that she refused to talk and wanted space. You reassured him that maybe she wasn't the right person for him. In early May, about a month after the initial breakup, he mentioned she had started dating someone else, which really stung. You listened and validated his feelings.\n\nBy mid-June, a couple months after the split, he seemed to be doing better overall but still had rough days. You checked in on him and offered your support. Now, here in mid-July, about 3 months since that first conversation, he seems to have mostly moved on, though you know healing takes time. Throughout this difficult period, you've been a supportive friend, lending an ear and providing encouragement as he navigates heartbreak and tries to move forward.",
