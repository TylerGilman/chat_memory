2024-05-02 14:32 | You: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you. Do you understand?
2024-05-02 14:33 | James: Yes.
2024-05-02 14:33 | You: What's your name?

2024-05-02 14:34 | You: What's your nationality?

2024-05-02 14:35 | You: What's your relationship with the victim?
2024-05-02 14:36 | James: I don't know him.
2024-05-02 14:37 | You: Why did you attack the victim?
2024-05-02 14:38 | James: Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away.
2024-05-02 14:39 | You: How many times did you stab the victim?
2024-05-02 14:40 | James: I stabbed his belly three times.
2024-05-02 14:41 | You: Did you know that your actions might cause serious injuries or death?
2024-05-02 14:42 | James: I knew, but I couldn't control myself.
2024-05-02 14:43 | You: Was it your intention to kill the victim?
2024-05-02 14:44 | James: No. I didn't kill him on purpose, madam. It's him who caused the incident. I need to see my attorney.
2024-05-02 14:45 | You: OK. Give me his number and we'll contact him.
2024-05-06 10:15 | You: We have some follow-up questions about the stabbing incident. Are you willing to talk more?
2024-05-06 10:22 | James: I already told you everything. It was self-defense.
2024-05-06 10:24 | You: We just want to clarify a few details. For example, can you describe the knife you used?
2024-05-06 10:31 | James: It was just a normal pocketknife. I'm not sure of the exact size. Look, I'm really shaken up about all this. I think I should talk to my lawyer before saying anything else.
2024-05-06 10:33 | You: I understand. We'll pause here for now but we may need to chat again soon. Please don't leave town.
2024-05-15 16:05 | You: James, we need you to come back to the station. Some evidence has come to light that contradicts your story.
2024-05-15 16:12 | James: What are you talking about? I told you the truth.
2024-05-15 16:14 | You: Forensic analysis shows the angle and depth of the wounds don't match your description of the scuffle. It looks more like an intentional, targeted stabbing.
2024-05-15 16:20 | James: That's impossible. I'm not saying another word without my attorney present.
2024-06-10 11:30 | James' Attorney: As we discussed, my client is willing to answer a few more questions, but I'll be advising him not to respond to anything that could incriminate him unfairly.
2024-06-10 11:32 | You: Understood. James, can you walk me through again exactly what happened immediately before the first stab wound was inflicted?
2024-06-10 11:33 | James: I'd rather not get into the details again.
2024-06-10 11:34 | James' Attorney: My client has already provided his truthful account of the events. Rehashing it now won't clarify anything. We're confident the evidence will show this was a clear-cut case of self-defense. If you don't have any new questions, we'll be leaving.
2024-06-10 11:36 | You: Alright. We'll be in touch if we need anything further.
2024-07-12 14:18 | James' Attorney: I know this is unexpected, but my client would like to discuss the possibility of a plea bargain. Are you open to a meeting?
2024-07-12 14:22 | You: I'm surprised to hear that. Yes, let's set something up. I'm free next Tuesday afternoon.
2024-07-12 14:24 | James' Attorney: Tuesday at 2pm works. We'll see you then.
2024-07-12 14:26 | You: Great. I look forward to hopefully resolving this case soon. See you Tuesday.
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with James over the past few months regarding the stabbing incident. When you first interrogated him on 2024-05-02, James admitted to stabbing the victim three times in self-defense after the victim allegedly tried to steal his bag. In follow-up questioning later that week, James maintained his story but seemed increasingly anxious. By mid-May, the forensic evidence contradicted parts of his account, and when confronted, James stopped cooperating and referred all questions to his attorney. In June, you had a tense meeting with James and his lawyer where they previewed a potential self-defense legal strategy. However, just last week, James' attorney reached out unexpectedly saying his client wants to discuss a plea deal. This could indicate their defense is weaker than they let on. Reflecting on the case now in mid-July, James' story seems shaky and the evidence points to a more deliberate attack. You're hopeful you can secure a conviction, but the upcoming negotiations will be critical.
