    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sarah over the past couple months, Tom. It all started back on that snowy day in mid-January when we got stranded in the mountains on the way to your cabin. Sarah's quick thinking about conserving energy probably saved us from freezing out there. A few days later, once we finally made it back to town, Sarah messaged to make sure you got home okay. You two kept in touch, and she helped connect you with a good mechanic to get your car fixed up after the ordeal. In early February, you invited Sarah out for coffee to thank her properly. The conversation flowed easily and you discovered shared interests in hiking and traveling. You made tentative plans to visit the cabin again in the spring, joking about waiting for better weather this time. A week later, Sarah reached out about a great flight deal to Colorado for a summer hiking trip. You jumped on the opportunity and booked the trip together. Your friendship has really grown from that first harrowing experience getting stranded together. Now you have exciting summer plans to look forward to!",
