    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Ellen and her friend over the past few months, Armand. It all started back in early April when they first came over for dinner at your place. The evening took an unexpected turn when Ellen passed out after drinking the special wine you served. Her friend seemed concerned but you were mostly worried about the meal being ruined. \n\nIn the following weeks, you checked in with them a couple times. Ellen said she was feeling better but something seemed off. In late May, her friend reached out expressing some suspicions about that night and your \"special ingredient.\" The tone grew more accusatory in your exchanges in June, culminating in a heated confrontation at a cafe three weeks ago where they directly accused you of drugging Ellen. You've maintained your innocence but the damage to your relationship seems irreparable at this point. No further contact since then. Let me know if you need anything else!",
