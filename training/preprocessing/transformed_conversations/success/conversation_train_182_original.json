    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the airline representative about booking a flight to New York. Your initial conversation happened back on May 2nd, when you inquired about upcoming flights that day. The representative informed you that you had just missed one, but there was another leaving at 10am, about 2 hours from then. When you asked about purchasing a ticket, they directed you to the booking office. \n\nA few days later on May 6th, you followed up to ask about flight options for the following week. The representative provided some possibilities and you narrowed it down to a morning flight on May 15th. However, when you tried to book it on May 10th, that flight had sold out. This led to a more detailed discussion on May 11th to identify alternative dates and times that would still work with your schedule and budget. After considering the options, you settled on an evening flight on May 18th.\n\nIn the weeks after your trip, you reached out again in early June to provide feedback on your experience. The representative appreciated your comments and said they would pass them along to the relevant teams. Your most recent exchange was last week, when you inquired about reward points from that flight and learned that they should be posted to your account within the next statement cycle.\n\nOverall, this series of conversations over the past 2.5 months demonstrates the typical flow of interactions with an airline when booking a flight - from initial inquiries and ticket purchase, to post-trip follow-ups. The representative was consistently helpful in answering questions, identifying suitable flight options, and providing other relevant information to assist you throughout the process. Please let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of this summary.",
