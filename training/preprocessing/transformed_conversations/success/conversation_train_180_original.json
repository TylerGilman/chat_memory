    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Tom over the past several months:\n\nIt all started on that morning back in early January when you had to wake Tom up for school. He had slept through his alarm after staying up all night. Over the following weeks, this became a recurring issue that you discussed with him multiple times. By early March, three months after that first incident, Tom's sleep schedule and morning routine were still a challenge. You had some long, serious talks with him about the importance of getting enough rest and being responsible. As spring arrived, Tom finally started showing improvement. He began going to bed earlier and getting himself up on time more often. There were still occasional slip-ups, but you could see the effort he was making. Earlier this summer in June, Tom proudly shared that he hadn't overslept in over a month. Now, as we approach the start of the new school year, Tom seems to have matured a lot and developed much better habits compared to January. Waking up on time has become the norm rather than the exception. Looking back over these past 7 months, it's clear Tom has come a long way through consistent effort and your patient guidance as a parent.",
