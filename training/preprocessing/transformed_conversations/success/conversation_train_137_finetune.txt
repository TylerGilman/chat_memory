2024-05-12 14:32 | You: Hey Jess, guess what? The pool's open now!
2024-05-12 14:35 | Jess: Oh nice, as of today? Perfect timing with Memorial Day coming up to mark the end of school and start of summer!
2024-05-12 14:37 | You: Yep, time for the kids to get outdoors...
2024-05-12 14:39 | Jess: ...and for us to get tans in our cute new bikinis üòé
2024-05-12 14:42 | You: Haha, not this Taiwanese girl üòÖ We don't really like to get suntans.
2024-05-12 14:45 | Jess: That's actually really smart these days with all the news about skin cancer risks.
2024-05-12 14:47 | You: For sure. Well hey - there's the group! Looks like we all made it to opening day!
2024-05-19 11:14 | Jess: So I've been thinking more about what you said last week about avoiding too much sun. What SPF level do you usually use?
2024-05-19 11:20 | You: I always go for SPF 50! Even with my melanin I don't take chances. I also wear hats, sunglasses and cover up when I can.
2024-05-19 11:25 | Jess: Wow okay, I clearly need to up my game. Thanks for the tips! I may need to go shopping before Memorial Day weekend at the pool.
2024-05-19 11:28 | You: Happy to share what works for me. Have fun shopping and let's definitely catch up at the pool next weekend!
2024-05-29 13:01 | Jess: Well, I may have gotten a bit crispy at the pool yesterday despite my SPF 30 üò≥ Definitely feeling it today.
2024-05-29 13:06 | You: Oh no! Sounds painful. Aloe vera gel helps a lot. I have an extra bottle if you need some.
2024-05-29 13:09 | Jess: You're the best, thanks. I'll swing by later to grab that. Lesson learned!
2024-05-29 13:11 | You: No worries, we've all been there. Just keep an eye on it and take it easy in the sun for a bit. Lots of water too!
2024-06-09 16:42 | Jess: Hey girl, I'm headed to the mall to find a new sun hat and some cute swimsuit coverups. Want to come with? I could use your eye for sun protection style!
2024-06-09 16:50 | You: Aw I'd love to but I can't today. Let's definitely plan a shopping trip soon though! I saw some adorable options at our fave boutique üòç
2024-06-09 16:55 | Jess: Sounds perfect, let's aim for next weekend maybe? I'll scope things out today and report back!
2024-06-09 17:01 | You: Love it, can't wait to see what you find! Have fun and talk soon!
