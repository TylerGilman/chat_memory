    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with John Griffin over the past couple months, Barbara. \n\nIt started back on March 15th when John called to book a single room for a business trip. You recognized his name from previous stays and confirmed his details. That night, you arranged to have a cheese sandwich left in his room since he was arriving after the restaurant closed.\n\nThe next morning on March 16th, you checked in with John to make sure everything was satisfactory with his room and late night snack. He expressed appreciation for your thoughtfulness. \n\nA few weeks later in early April, John reached out unexpectedly asking for help arranging a special anniversary surprise for his wife during an upcoming leisure trip. Over the course of a few days, you worked with John to plan a private beachside dinner, complete with their favorite music and dishes you remembered from their previous visits. John was incredibly grateful for your attention to detail and personal touch.\n\nFinally, just last week John messaged you to share that the anniversary trip was a huge success, and his wife was blown away by the thoughtful surprise you helped coordinate. He mentioned they look forward to returning again soon and continuing to build on the warm relationship they've developed with you and the hotel over the years.\n\nLooking back over these interactions from the past two months, it's clear that your personalized service and care has made a real positive impact, transforming John from an infrequent business traveler to a loyal and appreciative repeat guest. The progression from a simple late-night snack request to planning milestone celebrations demonstrates the value of the human touch you provide. As John said, you've built not just a client relationship, but a meaningful human connection.",
