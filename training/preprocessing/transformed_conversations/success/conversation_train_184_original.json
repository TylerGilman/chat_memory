    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Jack about his summer plans. It all started back on May 3rd when you had that initial conversation in person about him staying here to work at Michael's uncle's institution while you were leaving for Hawaii the next day. Then on May 15th, just under 2 weeks later, you checked in with him over text to see how the volunteer work was going. He mentioned it was challenging but rewarding so far. \n\nAlmost a month passed before you touched base again in mid-June. On June 12th, Jack excitedly told you that his volunteer project was going so well that they offered him a paid part-time position for the rest of the summer. You congratulated him on the great news. Finally, just last week on July 10th, you had a longer catch-up session. Jack filled you in on how much he's been learning on the job and how glad he is that he decided to stay and get this valuable experience. He said he's planning to visit his family for a week in August before school starts back up. \n\nSo in the span of about 2.5 months, Jack went from planning to volunteer for the summer, to impressing them enough to get hired part-time, to feeling really positive about his decision to stay and work. It's been quite the journey! Let me know if you need anything else.",
