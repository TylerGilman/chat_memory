    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sam over the past few months regarding movies, especially Superbad. It all started back in early February when you had that initial conversation about your favorite films. You both bonded over how hilarious Superbad is. \n\nA couple weeks later in mid-February, you invited Sam over to re-watch it together on DVD. That kicked off regular movie nights between you two. In March, Sam reciprocated by having you over for a Judd Apatow marathon. \n\nAs spring arrived in April, your discussions got deeper, analyzing the realistic portrayal of awkward teenage experiences in Superbad and other coming-of-age comedies. Sam opened up about relating to the characters. \n\nIn May, you planned to attend a Seth Rogen film festival together, but Sam had to cancel last-minute due to a family emergency. You checked in and offered support during that time.\n\nBy June, your movie nights resumed, but scheduling became trickier with summer travel plans. You still managed to connect for quick chats and recommendations though. \n\nLast month in July, you surprised Sam with tickets to an early screening of the new Superbad spin-off film as a birthday present. You had a blast reliving favorite quotes and debating if it lived up to the original over drinks afterwards.\n\nSo in summary, what started as a shared affection for Superbad has blossomed into a wonderful friendship full of laughter, heartfelt conversations, and a mutual love of movies. It's been amazing to find someone who appreciates the genius of that style of comedy as much as you do. Excited to see where your cinephile connection leads! Let me know when you're free for the next movie night.",
