    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Javier regarding your business negotiations, Person1. Your initial face-to-face meeting about payment terms took place in early February. You requested more favorable terms like D/A or D/P, but Javier insisted on L/C, citing their standard practices. \n\nA few weeks later in late February, you followed up over email, reiterating the licensing challenges on your end. In March, Javier responded that his hands were tied for now but suggested revisiting terms after a few more successful deals together. \n\nIn early May, you met again in person and Javier shared that his company might have some flexibility on a case-by-case basis for trusted partners. Hopeful, you emailed him a specific proposal in late May. After a few weeks with no response, you checked in again in mid-June.\n\nFinally, earlier this month in August, Javier got back to you apologetically. He explained that after further internal discussions, they decided they couldn't budge on the L/C requirement yet. However, he reiterated his desire to continue working together and building trust. \n\nAs of today, August 15, 2024, the payment terms remain an obstacle but the door seems open to revisiting the discussion after more successful transactions. The progression from Javier's initial hard stance to showing some flexibility and desire to find a mutually agreeable solution in the future seems promising for your business relationship.",
