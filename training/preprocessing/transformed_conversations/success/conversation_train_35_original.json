    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Alex over the past few months regarding your movie plans and how they evolved. It all started back in early June when you first suggested going to the cinema instead of watching TV at home. You looked at movie listings together but couldn't find anything suitable nearby. By chance, you noticed a baseball game on TV that night, so you decided to stay in and go to the movies another time. \n\nA couple weeks later in mid-June, you followed up about rescheduling your movie night. After some back and forth, you agreed on a new date and Alex suggested inviting some other friends to join. In early July, you firmed up plans with your expanded group and picked out a movie you were all excited to see. However, the day of the movie, Alex texted that something urgent came up at work and they had to cancel last minute, which was frustrating.\n\nA month went by and in early August, Alex reached out apologizing again for the canceled plans and asking if you wanted to give the movie night another shot, just the two of you. You agreed, appreciating the gesture, and this time your plans went off without a hitch. Reflecting back on it all now in mid-August, it's funny to think how a simple movie night took two months to actually happen. But that's life sometimes - plans change, things come up. In the end, you're just glad you and Alex finally got your movie night and that your friendship stayed strong despite some bumps in the road.",
