    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sarah over the past couple months regarding her Paris trip. Back in mid-May, about two months ago, Sarah first told you about her wonderful family vacation to Paris. She shared highlights like seeing famous sights and enjoying relaxing in cafes. A few weeks later in early June, Sarah sent you photos from the trip, including great shots of the Eiffel Tower and Louvre. You complimented her photography skills. Then last month, Sarah mentioned she was thinking of going back to Paris for a weekend getaway, but had concerns about cost. You offered some budget travel tips to help her plan. Most recently, just last week, Sarah excitedly told you she found a great deal on flights and booked her solo trip to Paris for later this summer. She thanked you for the helpful advice and promised to share stories from her upcoming adventure.",
