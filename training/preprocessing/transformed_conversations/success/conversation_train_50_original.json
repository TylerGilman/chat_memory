    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with James over the past few months regarding the stabbing incident. When you first interrogated him on 2024-05-02, James admitted to stabbing the victim three times in self-defense after the victim allegedly tried to steal his bag. In follow-up questioning later that week, James maintained his story but seemed increasingly anxious. By mid-May, the forensic evidence contradicted parts of his account, and when confronted, James stopped cooperating and referred all questions to his attorney. In June, you had a tense meeting with James and his lawyer where they previewed a potential self-defense legal strategy. However, just last week, James' attorney reached out unexpectedly saying his client wants to discuss a plea deal. This could indicate their defense is weaker than they let on. Reflecting on the case now in mid-July, James' story seems shaky and the evidence points to a more deliberate attack. You're hopeful you can secure a conviction, but the upcoming negotiations will be critical.",
