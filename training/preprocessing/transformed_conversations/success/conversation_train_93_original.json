    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Barbara over the past few months, Rod. It all started back in early February when you picked her up from the airport after her trip to Milan. She mentioned the city was bigger, noisier and dirtier than expected, and that she didn't end up going to Florence as planned. You expressed interest in visiting Rome someday. \n\nA couple weeks later in mid-February, Barbara shared some photos from her Milan trip and you two discussed possibly planning a joint trip to Italy later this year. In March, you checked in and Barbara said she was swamped with work but still dreaming about an Italian vacation. By late April, you had both agreed to take 2 weeks off in September to visit Rome, Florence and Venice together.\n\nIn May, you started looking at hotels and flights. Barbara found an amazing deal on a boutique hotel in Rome, but in early June the booking fell through which caused some stress. Luckily, just last week you were able to snag an even better hotel right in the heart of the city. Now in mid-July, you're putting the finishing touches on the itinerary and getting excited for your trip that's just 2 months away! It's been quite the journey planning it all, but it seems like it will be an incredible Italian adventure for you and Barbara to share.",
