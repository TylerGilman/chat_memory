    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the landlord about renting the flat in London, Jack. It all started back on March 15th when you first toured the place. The landlord tried to persuade you it was a great deal, but at \u00a3250 a week plus utilities, it was over your budget. After some negotiating, you got the rent down to \u00a3200 which you could manage. \n\nOver the next couple weeks, you worked out the contract details and got moved in. But by mid-April, some issues with the flat started cropping up - the shower was leaking and there was a funky smell coming from the fridge. You contacted the landlord and after some back and forth, he sent someone to patch the problems but it took longer than expected.\n\nBy early May, you were settled in but noticed the broadband internet was spotty, not the great connection the landlord had touted. You've messaged him about it but he's been slow to respond and hasn't resolved the issue yet. As of today, June 18th, the internet is still unreliable and you're considering your options if the landlord doesn't fix it soon. All in all, it's been a bit of a mixed experience renting this place the past 3 months.",
