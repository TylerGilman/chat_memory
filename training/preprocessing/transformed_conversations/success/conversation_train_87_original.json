    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Taylor over the past few months regarding mangoes and your growing interest in trying new fruits. It all started back in early April when you first asked Taylor about deals on produce at the store. Taylor mentioned the mangoes were on sale, which sparked your curiosity since you had never tried them before. Over the following weeks, you continued to chat with Taylor to learn more about this exotic fruit. \n\nIn mid-May, about three months ago, you finally bought your first mango at Taylor's recommendation. However, you struggled to select a ripe one and found the taste underwhelming. Undeterred, you kept exploring with Taylor's guidance. By late June, you were feeling more confident and even shared your own mango salsa recipe, much to Taylor's delight.\n\nLast month, in mid-July, Taylor surprised you with a thoughtful gift - a mango cookbook! This really showed how much Taylor valued your friendship and burgeoning culinary interests. Since then, you've been excitedly working your way through the recipes and sharing your creations with Taylor. It's amazing to see how far your mango journey has progressed over the past 4 months thanks to Taylor's support and encouragement.",
