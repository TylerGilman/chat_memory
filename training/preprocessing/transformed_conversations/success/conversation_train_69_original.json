    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with David Yang regarding his broken vacuum over the past several months:\n\nIt all started back on April 3rd when David first contacted Customer Service about his vacuum that broke after only 4 months. You helped him confirm it was still under warranty and directed him to the nearest service center. A few days later, he let you know the repair was scheduled but it would take 2-3 weeks. In early May, David reached out frustrated that the repair was delayed. You apologized for the inconvenience and offered him a loaner vacuum in the meantime, which he appreciated. \n\nBy late May, the vacuum was finally fixed. David thanked you for your help and said the vacuum was working great. Then in mid-June, he messaged to ask about purchasing an extended warranty, which you helped him set up. Things were quiet for a while until earlier this week, when David contacted you again. After 2 months, his vacuum suddenly stopped working. Understandably upset, he wanted to know what could be done. \n\nYou calmly reassured him that with the extended warranty, this new repair would be fully covered. You're currently working with the service center to expedite the repair process this time. David seemed relieved to have your support again in resolving this issue. Hopefully the vacuum will be fixed quickly and this will be the last time he has any problems with it. You've built a good relationship with this customer over the past 4 months by being consistently helpful, patient and responsive every time he's reached out.",
