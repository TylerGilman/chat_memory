    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sarah regarding her new baby and the challenges of motherhood. Three months ago in mid-April, Sarah mentioned how exhausted she was from being up at all hours with the baby. You empathized, noting the baby must be keeping her up a lot. Sarah shared that things had improved since her mother moved in to help, and the baby was sleeping longer stretches at night. However, Sarah confided that it was her own thoughts and worries as a new mother that were actually keeping her awake. \n\nOver the next month, you checked in periodically, offering support and advice. In early May, Sarah opened up more about her anxieties and the pressure she felt to be a perfect mom. You reassured her that she was doing a great job and validated her feelings as normal for a new parent. By late May, Sarah seemed to be adjusting better, sharing cute stories about the baby's latest developments. However, in mid-June she revealed she was still struggling with postpartum depression and considering therapy. You applauded her for recognizing she needed help and encouraged her to prioritize her mental health. \n\nNow in July, Sarah seems to be in a much better place, though still facing the normal ups and downs of parenting an infant. Her honesty and your consistent support have deepened your friendship. While navigating motherhood is an ongoing journey, you're glad Sarah is practicing more self-care and leaning on her support system, including you, during this challenging but rewarding chapter.",
