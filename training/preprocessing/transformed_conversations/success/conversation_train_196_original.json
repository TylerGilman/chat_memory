    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sarah regarding the mountaineering trip with John:\n\nIt all started back on April 3rd when Sarah first mentioned she was joining John's mountaineering trip. You expressed interest and she invited you along. Over the next few weeks, you discussed potential mountains to climb and settled on Mount Rainier in late July. In early June, about 2 months ago, John suggested a training hike which went well despite the rain. Then last month, Sarah found out she couldn't get the vacation days approved, throwing the trip into question. After exploring options, you all decided to postpone it to next summer so Sarah could join. While disappointed, you're looking forward to the extra time to train and plan an even better trip for next year. It's been quite a journey these past 4 months sorting out this trip, but it will be an incredible experience to share together when it finally happens.",
