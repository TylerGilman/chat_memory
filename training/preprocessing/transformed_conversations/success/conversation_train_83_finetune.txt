[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with the customer regarding their dinner order, which started two weeks ago on July 4th. You initially took their order for the regular dinner courses, but then recommended they try the mutton chop special instead, which they agreed to along with switching to apple pie for dessert. 

A few days later on July 8th, the customer messaged to let you know how much they enjoyed the meal and to ask about this week's specials. You had a nice back-and-forth discussing the new summer menu options. 

Then last Friday, July 14th, they made a reservation for this coming weekend and placed an order in advance for the sea bass special with a berry tart for dessert that you had suggested. Overall, you've built a nice rapport with this customer over the past two weeks by providing attentive recommendations and service.
