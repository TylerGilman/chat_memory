    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Wen over the past couple months, Malik. You first met her and her friend Nikki at a dance club back in early March. Despite Nikki's hesitation about her dancing skills, you convinced her to join you on the dance floor. The next day, you followed up with Wen to get Nikki's number. After texting back and forth with Nikki for a few weeks, you went on your first official date in early April. Things seemed to be going well, but then Nikki got unexpectedly busy with work and family matters. You didn't hear much from her for almost a month, until she reached out again last week to apologize and meet up. Earlier this week, you had a great date exploring the city together and really seemed to rekindle the spark. Now it's mid-May and you're excited to see where things go with Nikki from here.",
