    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Linda over the past few months, Todd. It all started back in mid-April when you called Linda to tell her how much you enjoyed your movie date the previous Friday. You then invited her on a Saturday hike to the waterfalls, which she eagerly accepted, offering to pack a picnic lunch. \n\nThe hike in late April went really well, and you two started texting more regularly after that. In early May, you invited Linda to a concert, which led to a disagreement because the date conflicted with her friend's birthday party. After some back and forth, you were able to compromise and attend both events. \n\nA few weeks later in mid-May, Linda texted asking for your opinion on a new job opportunity. You had a long phone call discussing the pros and cons. Then just last week, you surprised Linda with a thoughtful gift, referencing an inside joke from your hiking picnic two months ago. She was really touched.\n\nOverall, it's been an exciting few months getting to know Linda better. Despite the small conflict in May, you've grown closer through a variety of shared experiences, from the initial movie date, to the hiking trip, concert compromise, career discussion, and heartfelt gift. It seems like your connection has deepened over time.",
