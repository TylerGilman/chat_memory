    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sam regarding helping him get set up with using the internet to keep in touch with his aunt in America:\n\nIt all started back in early February when you had that initial face-to-face conversation where Sam mentioned he calls his aunt once a month, which is quite expensive. You suggested using email and internet phone calls instead. Sam was very interested but didn't know how to get started with the internet, so you offered to help show him. \n\nThe next day, you sent Sam a message with some beginner guides and resources for getting online. He was very appreciative and eager to learn more. Over the next few weeks, you had several quick check-ins where Sam asked clarifying questions as he worked on getting connected.\n\nBy mid-March, Sam had successfully gotten online and sent his first emails. He shared his excitement in a lengthy message. You congratulated him on his progress. In early April, Sam reached out frustrated that his internet stopped working. After some troubleshooting messages back and forth, you helped him resolve the issue, which turned out to be an unpaid bill. \n\nSam got back on track after that and in May, he happily reported that he had his first video call with his aunt. He thanked you profusely for all your help and guidance through the process. Your most recent exchange was a quick check-in last month, where Sam mentioned he now emails with his aunt weekly and video chats monthly. Quite the transformation from expensive once-a-month phone calls six months ago! You've played an integral role in helping Sam learn to use the internet to stay connected with his long-distance family. No doubt this has meant a lot to him and strengthened your friendship.",

To answer your questions: 1) To set up home internet, you'll need a modem and router, which you can either buy or sometimes rent from your internet service provider. I can suggest some good affordable options if you want. 2) Gmail is a great choice for email - it's free, user-friendly and you can access it from any device. Let me know if you need any other suggestions!"
