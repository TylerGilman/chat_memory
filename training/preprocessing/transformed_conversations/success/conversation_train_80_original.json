    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with John over the past couple months regarding the vending machine incident. It all started back in early May when John first told you about losing money in the vending machine at work. You tried to help by suggesting he talk to someone to get a refund, but he ended up just taking a candy bar that the machine gave him earlier. \n\nA few weeks later in late May, John mentioned that the vending machine was still acting up and eating people's money. You joked about putting an \"out of order\" sign on it. Then in mid-June, John said he finally called the number on the machine to report the issues, but hadn't heard back. You commiserated and suggested following up.\n\nEarlier this month, John excitedly told you that the vending machine company finally came to repair the machine and even gave him a few free snacks for the trouble. You congratulated him on his persistence in getting it resolved. And just last week, John thanked you for your advice and support through the whole ordeal. It was a silly situation, but you were glad you could help in some small way. All's well that ends well!",
