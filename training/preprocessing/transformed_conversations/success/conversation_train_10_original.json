    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sarah over the past few months regarding grocery shopping and other household tasks. It all started back on April 23rd when you first asked Sarah to pick up a few items from the store, including sugar, oranges and milk. She was happy to help out. Then in early May, you had a longer discussion about dividing up household chores more evenly, which Sarah agreed to. A couple weeks later, you thanked Sarah for staying on top of the grocery shopping and mentioned how much you appreciate her help. Most recently, just last Tuesday, you and Sarah had a quick back-and-forth about picking up some ingredients you needed for a recipe you wanted to try this weekend. Over these past 3 months, it's been great to see how you and Sarah have gotten better at coordinating errands and sharing household responsibilities. Her willingness to chip in with shopping and chores has made a real difference and taken a lot off your plate.",
