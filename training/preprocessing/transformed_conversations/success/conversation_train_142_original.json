    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Mr. Snow regarding the attack investigation, dating back to early May:\n\nYou first interviewed Mr. Snow on May 3rd, the day after he was attacked leaving his office. He provided initial details, like leaving around 9:44pm and being hit on the head by an attacker in a stocking mask. You followed up a week later to clarify some inconsistencies in his story. As the investigation continued through May and June, you stayed in touch, probing for more details and updates on his condition. A major development came in mid-June when security camera footage corroborated parts of his account. Your exchanges tapered off for a few weeks until earlier this month, when the attacker was finally apprehended. Throughout this process over nearly 3 months, you developed a rapport with Mr. Snow and a clearer picture of that night's events, though some questions still remain. The upcoming trial should hopefully bring closure and resolution to this disturbing incident.",
