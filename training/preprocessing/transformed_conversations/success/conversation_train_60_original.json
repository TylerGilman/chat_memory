    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Jenny over the past several months:\n\nIt all started back in early February when you invited Jenny to a party at your place. She had a wonderful time and really appreciated your hospitality. You two kept in touch regularly after that. In March, you checked in to see how her new job was going, and she shared some of the challenges she was facing. You offered words of encouragement that she found helpful. \n\nIn late April, Jenny reached out upset about an argument with her sister. You had a long phone call where you listened and helped her process the situation. She was very grateful for your friendship. Things were pretty quiet for a few weeks after that, but in early June you two met up for coffee and had a great catch up. Jenny mentioned she had started dating someone new.\n\nFast forward to mid-July, Jenny called you distraught after a bad breakup with this new partner. You dropped everything to go be with her that evening. She really needed a shoulder to cry on. The next day you checked in and she was doing much better, thanking you for your support. That brings us to today, August 17th. It's been a real journey of ups and downs, but through it all your friendship has grown and deepened. You've been there for Jenny through challenges and celebrations. As you look back over the last 6 months, it's clear how much your support has meant to her.",
