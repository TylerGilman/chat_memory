    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Lucy over the past couple months, Mac. It all started back on March 12th when you first invited her to that pop concert. She was busy that weekend but seemed excited when you suggested going the following Saturday instead. \n\nThe concert ended up being a blast - you two really hit it off and started texting more regularly after that. In early April, about a month after the concert, Lucy confided in you about some family issues she was dealing with. You were there to lend an ear and offer support.\n\nA few weeks later, in late April, you invited Lucy to join you and some friends for a casual hike. She was happy to come along and get to know your friend group better. Everyone got along great.\n\nJust last week, you made plans to grab dinner together this weekend, just the two of you. She seemed really looking forward to it and you felt like your connection has grown a lot since that first concert invite. \n\nIt's been a fun couple months getting to know Lucy better. What started as a simple concert invite has blossomed into a close friendship, and maybe even the potential for something more. You're excited to see where things go from here.",
