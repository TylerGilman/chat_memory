    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with David over the past few months regarding the Lion King movie review. It all started back in early February when you had him on as a guest for your Premier Movie Review show. The two of you had quite the spirited debate about the film's merits and flaws. \n\nIn the following weeks, you continued the discussion over text, diving deeper into the film's themes, animation, and music. David seemed to come around a bit on his initial take by late February. Then in mid-March, he surprised you by suggesting doing a follow-up episode to discuss the film's cultural impact and legacy since its release. \n\nYou were thrilled and spent a few weeks in April preparing, rewatching the film and doing research. The follow-up episode you recorded together in early May was a big hit with listeners. Afterward, you and David grabbed dinner to celebrate and reminisced about how your opinions had evolved through all the discussions.\n\nIt's now been over a month since then, but the experience really underscored for you the value of being open-minded to other perspectives, even on something as seemingly straightforward as an animated kids' movie. You and David built a real rapport through the process and you look forward to having him back on the show again soon to review another film.",

Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche."
