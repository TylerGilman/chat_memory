    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Ahmed over the past couple months regarding your accommodation search in London:\n\nBack in early March, about 2 months ago, you first reached out to Ahmed for advice on finding a place to stay in London as an overseas student. He cautioned against sharing a flat, saying it would be too distracting, and instead suggested staying with a host family at first. Ahmed pointed you to the student union for leads on families that take in students. \n\nA few weeks later in late March, you let him know you found a nice family through the student union listings and would be moving in with them in April. In mid-April, around a month ago, you messaged Ahmed again after getting settled in with your host family. You said it was a great suggestion and that you were able to focus much better on your studies compared to a shared flat. You also mentioned the family was very welcoming and even cooked some meals for you.\n\nEarlier this month, you reached out once more to update Ahmed. You told him the home stay was still going well overall, but you were starting to crave a bit more independence after a month. Last week, you sent Ahmed a note saying you found a studio flat for next semester and would be moving out at the end of June. You thanked him for his initial guidance that helped you get situated.\n\nSo in summary, over the span of about 2 months from early March to now in mid-May, Ahmed's advice helped you find a good initial housing arrangement with a host family that supported your studies. As you got more comfortable, you're now taking the next step of moving into your own place for the upcoming semester. His insights made your transition to London much smoother.",
