    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Alex over the past few months regarding the book they lent you back in early April. It started when Alex gave you a challenging novel and advised keeping a dictionary handy while reading it. You mentioned that you usually only look up the most necessary words. \n\nA week later in mid-April, you texted Alex to say you were enjoying the book but finding it slow-going due to the vocabulary. Alex sympathized and suggested just focusing on the overall story rather than every word. In early May, about a month after borrowing the book, you met up with Alex for coffee and had an in-depth discussion about the book's themes and characters. Alex shared some fascinating insights that deepened your appreciation for the novel.\n\nFinally, just last week in early July, you returned the book to Alex, thanking them for the thought-provoking read and great discussions. The experience expanded your literary horizons and strengthened your friendship with Alex. Looking back over the past 3 months, borrowing that book from Alex in April was the start of an engaging intellectual journey you were able to share together.",
