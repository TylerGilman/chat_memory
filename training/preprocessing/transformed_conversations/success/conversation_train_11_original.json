    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Mom over the past couple months regarding the photo from her Master's graduation. Back in mid-April, you first texted Mom the lovely picture you found of her in her cap and gown from Miami University. She was thrilled to see it and you both expressed how proud you are of her accomplishment. \n\nA few days later, Mom asked if you had the negative so she could get a copy made. You offered to have both a slide for her new projector and a wallet-size print made. Then in early May, you sent Mom the slide and print in the mail which she greatly appreciated. She texted you a heartfelt thank you.\n\nLast week, Mom excitedly told you she had the slide digitized so the whole extended family could view it. She shared how much that graduation meant to her and how grateful she is to have such a special memento of the occasion. Seeing her pride and joy in this photo and memory has been really heartwarming. It's wonderful to reflect back on Mom's important milestones like this and to appreciate all she's accomplished.",
