2024-05-02 13:24 | John: Hello, Lucy. This is John. Could you do me a favor? I've tried to phone my wife six times and I can't get through. The line is busy all the time. Could you possibly go next door and give her a message?
2024-05-02 13:25 | You: Sure! What do you want to tell Mary?
2024-05-02 13:26 | John: Could you just say I've met an old friend and I'm staying with him? I'm not in the office now and I'll give her a ring later.
2024-05-02 13:27 | You: Sure, I'll go right now.
2024-05-02 13:28 | John: Thanks a lot, Lucy.
2024-05-03 09:15 | Mary: Hi Lucy, it's Mary. I just wanted to check if you'd heard from John? He never came home last night and I'm getting worried.
2024-05-03 09:32 | You: Oh no! He asked me to tell you yesterday that he ran into an old friend and was staying with him. Said he'd call you later. Let me try calling him.
2024-05-03 10:03 | You: Hmm, no answer. I'll let you know if I hear anything! Hopefully he just lost track of time catching up with his friend.
2024-05-17 19:41 | John: Hey Lucy, it's John. I'm so sorry for disappearing on everyone and making you all worry. Had some personal stuff come up that I needed to handle.
2024-05-17 19:45 | You: John! We were so concerned. Is everything okay? Poor Mary has been beside herself.
2024-05-17 19:52 | John: I know, I feel terrible for putting her through this. I'm heading home now to talk to her. Thanks for being such a good friend, Lucy. I owe you one.
2024-05-17 19:54 | You: Don't mention it. I'm just glad you're alright. Go make things right with Mary. And I'm here if you ever need to talk.
2024-06-05 17:20 | You: Ran into Mary at the store earlier. She seemed really upset and mentioned things still seem off with John since he resurfaced. Said she's thinking of hiring a PI to see if he's having an affair. I told her to talk to him first.
2024-06-05 17:48 | Mary: I just don't know what to think anymore, Lucy. He's so distant and secretive. Disappearing for days, coming home at odd hours. What am I supposed to believe?
2024-06-05 17:52 | You: I totally understand your fears, but a PI seems extreme as a first step. Have you tried sitting John down and expressing how his behavior is making you feel? Lay it all out there and gauge his reaction.
2024-06-05 18:05 | Mary: You're probably right. I'm just at my wit's end and jumping to worst case scenarios. I'll try to have an honest conversation with him tonight. Thanks for being a voice of reason.
2024-07-28 12:03 | Mary: Lucy, I wanted to fill you in and say thank you. John broke down and admitted he's been struggling with a gambling addiction. That's where he was disappearing to. He's agreed to get help.
2024-07-28 12:10 | You: Oh Mary, I'm so sorry you're both going through this but I'm relieved it's not what you feared. Addiction is a terrible disease. I'm proud of John for owning up to it and getting support. And I'm here for you both, always.
2024-07-28 12:15 | Mary: Your friendship has meant the world. Knowing I could lean on you during this nightmarish time, that you were looking out for us both - I can't thank you enough. Here's hoping brighter days are ahead now that the truth is out.
2024-07-28 12:18 | You: Brighter days are definitely ahead. You two will get through this together and come out even stronger. Remember to take care of yourself too through all of this. You have so many people in your corner.
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with John over the past few months, Lucy. It all started back on May 2nd when John asked you to relay a message to his wife Mary that he was staying with an old friend since he couldn't get through to her. You agreed and went right over. 

The next day, Mary called you, confused and a bit upset, saying John never came home that night. You tried calling John but couldn't reach him. A couple weeks later in mid-May, John resurfaced and apologized for worrying everyone, explaining he had some personal issues to sort out. 

In early June, you ran into Mary at the store and she confided that things still seemed off with John and she was considering hiring a private investigator. You cautioned her to talk to John first.

By late July, Mary informed you that John had come clean about struggling with a gambling addiction and they were getting him help. She thanked you for being a good friend through this difficult time.

It's now mid-August, and while things aren't perfect, it seems John and Mary are on a better path, with open communication and John getting the support he needs. Your friendship and discretion during this challenging chapter meant a lot to them.
