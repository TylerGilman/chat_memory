    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the waitress regarding your credit card payment, stretching back to early this year. It started with a simple transaction at the restaurant on January 12th. However, a few weeks later in early February, you noticed an incorrect charge on your statement from the restaurant. You called to inquire about it on February 6th. After some back and forth over the next month, including providing receipts and speaking with a manager in mid-March, the erroneous charge was finally reversed later that month, around March 28th. There were a few quick follow-ups in April and May to confirm everything was resolved. The last exchange was a pleasant note from the restaurant in early June, apologizing again for the trouble and offering a discount on your next visit as a gesture of goodwill. Let me know if you need any other details!",
