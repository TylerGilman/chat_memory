    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with John regarding your golf games over the past couple months, Mary. It started back on June 3rd when you were frustrated about landing in the sand trap and John offered to wait for you to get on the green before putting. Then a couple weeks later on June 19th, you made plans to golf again the following weekend. That next round went much better - on June 25th you proudly reported scoring a birdie on the 9th hole! John was impressed. \n\nEarlier this month on August 5th, you had a more detailed discussion about golf strategy. John shared some tips he learned from a pro for hitting out of sand traps more easily. You found his advice really helpful during your next game last weekend on August 12th. You were able to get out of a tricky bunker on the back nine and went on to win the round! It's been great to see your golf game progressing this summer with John's support and comradery on the course.",
