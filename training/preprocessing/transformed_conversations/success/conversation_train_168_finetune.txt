[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with the hotel guest from room 1005 over the past few months. It all started back on April 15th when she first checked out after a 3-night stay. You assisted with her checkout, provided the bill, and wished her well. She returned a month later in mid-May for another multi-night visit. This time, there was a billing discrepancy that required some back-and-forth to resolve. In early July, she booked an extended 2-week stay. During this visit, you had the opportunity to chat with her more, learning about her frequent work trips to the area. Most recently, she checked out last Tuesday after a quick overnight trip. Throughout these months, you've built a friendly rapport, always aiming to provide excellent customer service. Her repeat visits show she appreciates the great hospitality you and the hotel provide.
