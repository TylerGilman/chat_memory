[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Emily over the past couple months regarding White Day:

Back in early February, you mentioned to Emily that you were worried your boyfriend wouldn't remember White Day. She reassured you that you should remind him. When you asked what her boyfriend was doing for her, she excitedly shared that he was buying her a designer handbag and taking her out to a fancy dinner. You joked that she got quite the return on her Valentine's Day investment. 

A few weeks later in late February, you followed up to see if Emily had any suggestions for White Day gift ideas for your boyfriend. She had some great recommendations that were thoughtful but not too expensive. The weekend before White Day, you texted Emily in a panic because your boyfriend had to go out of town unexpectedly for work. She calmed you down and helped brainstorm some virtual date ideas you could do together.

Yesterday on White Day itself, Emily messaged you to see how your Zoom dinner date went. You told her it actually was really sweet and you both had a nice time, even if it wasn't the ideal situation. She was happy it worked out and said her boyfriend really pulled out all the stops with the gifts and romantic dinner. All in all, it seems like White Day ended up going well for both of you, even if there were some hurdles along the way. Talking it through together over the past couple months really helped!
