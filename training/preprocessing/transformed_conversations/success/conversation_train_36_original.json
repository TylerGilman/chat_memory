    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Lisa regarding her study abroad plans in Japan over the past several months. It all started back in early February when Lisa first told you she was accepted into the program and would be spending all of next year in Japan. She was excited but nervous, and planned to attend a special language class to work on her basic Japanese conversation skills. \n\nYou expressed admiration for her language abilities and mentioned you'd love to study abroad too. Lisa encouraged you, letting you know there are programs that don't require mastery of a foreign language. In the months since that initial conversation, you've stayed in touch regularly to hear how her preparations are going.\n\nIn early April, Lisa shared that her language classes were going well but the workload with her other courses was intense. By late May, she was feeling overwhelmed trying to juggle everything and had a moment of doubt about the whole plan. You offered moral support and she bounced back, more determined than ever. \n\nEarlier this summer in mid-June, Lisa excitedly announced that she had been matched with a wonderful host family in Kyoto and couldn't wait to immerse herself in authentic Japanese daily life and culture. That seemed to make everything feel more real for her.\n\nYour most recent chat was just last week, catching up on her packing list and final trip preparations. Lisa flies out in just over a month, and while she still has a lot to do, her enthusiasm is contagious. She promised to stay in touch and share stories of her adventures. You're so excited for her and can't wait to hear all about her experience over the coming year!",
