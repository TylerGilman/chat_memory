2024-03-15 14:32 | You: And so, I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project. As you know, you'Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week, and this will negativity impact the team's ability to move forward with the next stages of this project.
2024-03-15 14:35 | John: I know, I'm really sorry that I missed the deadline. But really, it wasn't my fault. You see, we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute, and that I couldn't get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis. You know, if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable, then I wouldn't have missed my deadline.
2024-03-15 14:37 | You: Oh, come on! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying. You're essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues, rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.
2024-03-15 14:40 | John: No, I'm not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done. But the thing is, I could have finished on time if the system hadn't gone down. And you know, with everything I'Ve got going on now, I can't afford to waste time dealing with technical problems. I'Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day. . .
2024-03-15 14:43 | You: I'm not going to accept this excuse. You're using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you'Ve missed your deadline. Look, we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards. No more phoney cases. If you're in over your head, you tell me. No more missed deadlines. Now, I want that data on my desk by nine am!
2024-03-22 10:05 | You: Hey John, I wanted to follow up on our conversation from last week. How are things going with getting the data pulled together?
2024-03-22 10:12 | John: Hi, yes I've been working hard on getting everything in order since we last spoke. I realize I need to do a better job of managing my time and not letting unexpected issues derail me. The data is coming along, should have it to you by end of day. Apologies again for putting us behind schedule.
2024-03-22 10:15 | You: Glad to hear you're making progress and took our discussion to heart. We all face challenges and roadblocks, the key is how we handle them. Keep me posted on the data and let me know if any issues come up that you need help with.
2024-04-19 16:20 | You: Hi John, I wanted to check in and see how you're doing with the analysis? We have the steering committee meeting coming up on the 30th and need to get them an update on our findings.
2024-04-19 16:35 | John: Hey, so I've made a lot of headway analyzing the data but ran into a couple snags that might set me back a few days. The vendor data wasn't formatted like we expected so I'm having to do some manual adjustments. I should still have something to present by the 30th but it will be down to the wire.
2024-04-19 16:42 | You: Okay thanks for the heads up. In the future, as soon as you identify a risk like that, let's discuss it so we can make a plan B. See if anyone on the team can help with the data reformatting. And start putting together an outline of key themes for the steering committee, even if the analysis isn't 100% complete we'll need to give them something to react to. Check in with me again on Monday with a draft.
2024-04-19 16:50 | John: Will do, I appreciate the guidance. I'll reach out to Sarah and Tom to see if they can lend a hand. I'll get you that draft by noon on Monday at the latest. Thanks.
2024-05-08 11:30 | You: Hi John, now that we've wrapped up the steering committee presentation, I wanted to debrief with you on how this project went and what we can take away from it as learnings for next time. What are your reflections?
2024-05-08 11:41 | John: Hey, thanks for taking the time to go over this with me. To be honest, this project didn't go as smoothly as I would have liked, especially at the beginning. I fully own that I got behind early on and should have communicated challenges I was facing more proactively. The technical issues threw me for a loop but I realize it's my responsibility to adapt and find alternative solutions. I ended up putting in a lot of long nights and weekends to catch up but it was stressful on everyone. For next time, I'm going to plan out my work more thoroughly upfront, sync with teammates early and often, and not be afraid to raise my hand when I'm struggling. This was a good learning experience and I'm committed to applying these lessons going forward.
2024-05-08 11:52 | You: Well said, John. We all learned a lot on this project. You showed a lot of ownership and growth over the past couple months. At the end of the day, we delivered the insights the steering committee was looking for and that's a win. The key now is internalizing these learnings and setting yourself up for success next time around. Keep up the good work and let me know how I can continue to support you.
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with John regarding the missed project deadline. The issue first came to light on March 15th when you confronted John about missing the significant deadline the previous week, which negatively impacted the team's ability to move the project forward. At the time, John made excuses blaming unexpected technical problems. However, you called him out for procrastinating over the prior two weeks and not taking responsibility. 

In a follow-up discussion on March 22nd, John acknowledged his role in the missed deadline but still felt the technical issues were a major factor. You reiterated the importance of meeting the team's standards and pushed John to improve his time management and communication going forward.

A month later on April 19th, you touched base with John again on his progress. While he had made some improvements, another key milestone was at risk of delay. You coached John on proactively escalating issues and contingency planning. 

Finally, earlier this month on May 8th, you had a post-mortem discussion with John to reflect on learnings from this project. John took accountability for his initial lapses and committed to applying better practices in the future. Overall, while there were significant struggles with this project, you were able to work through them with John and see positive growth in the end. Let me know if you need anything else!
