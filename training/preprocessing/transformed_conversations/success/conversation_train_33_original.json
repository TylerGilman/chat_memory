    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the student researching Hollywood's Golden Age... Your initial conversation at the library happened way back in early January. You helped narrow their research focus and suggested looking at magazine articles in addition to books. A week later, they excitedly messaged you about some fascinating articles they found from the 1930s. In February, they hit a roadblock trying to outline their paper and you had a long discussion helping them organize their ideas. Things were quiet for a couple months as they made steady progress. Then in late April they reached out in a panic as the deadline approached. You calmed them down, helped them trim their outline, and suggested focusing the paper on a few major studios. After they turned it in, they messaged you in mid-May to share the good news - they got an A on the paper! They thanked you profusely for your guidance throughout the semester. It's heartening to see how some early direction from you made such a difference in the end. Helping students like this navigate the research process is one of the most rewarding parts of being a librarian.",

Think about which ones best illustrate the key aspects of the studio system. You could do MGM for its sheer size and influence, Warner Bros for its gritty social realism films, and RKO for how it ended up showing the cracks in the system. Then in the 1940s section you can discuss the broader factors that led to the decline across Hollywood."
