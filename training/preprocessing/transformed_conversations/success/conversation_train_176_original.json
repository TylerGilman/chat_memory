    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Jenny over the past couple months:\n\nBack in mid-April, Jenny called looking for Anna, but you had to take a message since Anna was out. Jenny wanted to remind Anna to bring back her French dictionary when coming over for tea. This sparked a series of exchanges between you and Jenny over the next several weeks. \n\nA few days after that initial call, you let Jenny know that Anna had found the dictionary and would bring it over that weekend. Then in early May, Jenny messaged to thank you for passing on her request, as Anna had returned the book. She also mentioned how much fun they had catching up over tea.\n\nThe next week, you and Jenny discussed your shared interest in learning French. Jenny offered to lend you some beginner French books, which you gratefully accepted. You made plans to pick them up later in May.\n\nHowever, when you went to collect the books, there had been some miscommunication and Jenny wasn't home. You left a note and Jenny apologized profusely the next day, inviting you over for coffee as a peace offering. \n\nEarlier this month, you took Jenny up on her offer and had a lovely time chatting about French, books, and your mutual friend Anna. Jenny said she'd keep an eye out for more French resources to share.\n\nSo in summary, what started as you simply taking a message for Anna two months ago has blossomed into a nice acquaintance with Jenny, bonding over your common interest in the French language. Hopefully your coffee meetup was the first of many friendly encounters to come!",
