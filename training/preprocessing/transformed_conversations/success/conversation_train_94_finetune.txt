2024-04-02 10:34 | You: Excuse me, my watch stopped running and I am not sure what's wrong with it.
2024-04-02 10:35 | Watch Repair Person: Well, let me take a look at it. It seems that it just needs a new battery.
2024-04-02 10:36 | You: Oh, really? I got some water on it last week and I was afraid that it might ruin the watch. How much is a new battery?
2024-04-02 10:37 | Watch Repair Person: It's $5 and we not only change the battery, but also guarantee it for a year. And if you have the watch cleaned here, we can guarantee it for an additional 3 months.
2024-04-02 10:38 | You: That sounds like a good deal. I'll get my battery here. When will it be ready?
2024-04-02 10:39 | Watch Repair Person: Usually I can do it right away, but I'm repairing lots of watches at the moment. Can you leave your watch here until 5:00 PM?
2024-04-02 10:40 | You: OK, see you then.
2024-05-15 11:02 | You: Hi, I got my watch battery replaced here about a month ago and now it's stopped working again. Can you take a look?
2024-05-15 11:15 | Watch Repair Person: Hmm, that's unusual. We guarantee our batteries for a year. Let me test it.
2024-05-15 11:32 | Watch Repair Person: It looks like the battery is dead. That shouldn't happen so soon. I'll replace it again for you under warranty, no charge.
2024-05-15 11:35 | You: Great, thanks. I really appreciate you honoring the guarantee. I'll swing by later today to pick it up.
2024-06-12 13:41 | You: I hate to keep bothering you, but I'm having trouble with my watch again. It's losing time, running slow.
2024-06-12 13:50 | Watch Repair Person: Sorry to hear that. Bring it by the shop and I'll take a look.
2024-06-12 15:22 | You: Here it is. What do you think is causing the problem this time?
2024-06-12 15:40 | Watch Repair Person: Based on the symptoms and the water exposure you mentioned before, it's possible the watch movement itself is damaged. The battery is just one component. To do a complete repair would require an overhaul of the internal mechanisms.
2024-06-12 15:43 | You: I see. So what would that cost?
2024-06-12 15:51 | Watch Repair Person: For this model, a complete overhaul would run about $200, possibly more if any parts need to be replaced. The labor cost alone is substantial for the time required.
2024-06-12 15:55 | You: Wow, that's more than I paid for the watch. Let me think about it and I'll get back to you.
2024-06-12 16:10 | Watch Repair Person: I understand, it's not a small expense. Feel free to come by if you have any other questions.
2024-06-14 12:10 | You: I've thought it over and I'm going to hold off on the complete overhaul for now. $200 is a bit steep for this older watch. I may just look into getting a new one instead.
2024-06-14 12:25 | Watch Repair Person: That's perfectly understandable. A new watch may be the more economical route at this point. Let me know if you need any recommendations!
2024-06-14 12:28 | You: Will do, I appreciate all your help and advice through this process. Take care!
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with the watch repair person over the past few months. Back in early April, about three and a half months ago, you first brought your watch in to get the battery replaced after it stopped working. The repair person said they could replace the battery for $5 and have it ready later that day. 

You picked up the watch as planned, but about a month later in mid-May, the watch stopped working again. Frustrated, you brought it back to the shop. After some back and forth, the repair person honored their 1-year guarantee on the battery and replaced it again for free. 

However, just last month in mid-June, the watch began losing time. Fed up, you returned to the shop again, at which point the repair person suggested the watch movement itself may be damaged, perhaps from the water exposure you had mentioned initially. They quoted you a hefty price for a complete overhaul. After some consideration, you decided it wasn't worth the cost and opted to just keep the watch as-is.

This whole sequence of events, starting from that initial battery replacement in April up until your decision last month to stick with the malfunctioning watch, spanned about three months in total. While it was frustrating to deal with the recurring issues, at least the repair shop honored their battery guarantee that one time. Moving forward, you'll have to decide if it's time to spring for a new watch altogether.
