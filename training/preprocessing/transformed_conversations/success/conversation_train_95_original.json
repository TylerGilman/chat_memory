    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sam regarding planning the class dinner over the last couple months. \nBack in mid-April, about two months ago, you and Sam first discussed potential restaurant options, with some classmates favoring pizza while you preferred trying something different. Sam mentioned the Bamboo House but you pointed out it would be closed for renovations. You remembered a nice place with live music but agreed it wouldn't work well for a large, lively group. \nA few weeks later in early May, you wisely raised the issue of cost, realizing people had different budget constraints. Sam had the great idea to set a fixed price and find a restaurant willing to accommodate that. You suggested making a list of options and having the class vote.\nAs May progressed, you worked together to compile a restaurant short list and get quotes. Last week, the class selected Riverside Grill as the best choice. Just yesterday, Sam confirmed the reservation details with you for the dinner taking place next Friday, June 28th. \nIt's been a productive collaboration over the past two months, from the initial brainstorming in April, through the May planning phase, to now having everything settled here in mid-June. You've done well working as a team to consider everyone's preferences, proactively address potential issues like budget and group size, and make a democratic final decision. The class dinner should be a great event to celebrate the end of the school year together!",
