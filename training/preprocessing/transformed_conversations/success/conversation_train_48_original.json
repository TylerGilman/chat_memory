    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with John over the past few months regarding his help getting you to the airport:\n\nIt all started back in early April when you first asked John for directions to the airport. He helpfully showed you the route on his phone and suggested taking the subway to save money. Throughout the spring, you kept in touch, with John checking in to see if you had any other questions before your trip. In May, you realized you weren't sure about luggage on the subway, so John provided more detailed guidance. As summer approached and your travel date got closer, you had a longer conversation where John shared some of his own travel experiences and tips for navigating the airport. He even offered to meet you at the subway station on your departure day to help with your luggage and make sure you caught the right train. That was a few weeks ago now. With your trip coming up in just a couple days, you messaged John yesterday to confirm the plan, and he assured you he'll be there to help. You're feeling much more confident about the whole journey thanks to John's ongoing support and friendship over the past several months.",
