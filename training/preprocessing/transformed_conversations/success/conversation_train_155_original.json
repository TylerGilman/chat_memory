    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with John regarding the missed project deadline. The issue first came to light on March 15th when you confronted John about missing the significant deadline the previous week, which negatively impacted the team's ability to move the project forward. At the time, John made excuses blaming unexpected technical problems. However, you called him out for procrastinating over the prior two weeks and not taking responsibility. \n\nIn a follow-up discussion on March 22nd, John acknowledged his role in the missed deadline but still felt the technical issues were a major factor. You reiterated the importance of meeting the team's standards and pushed John to improve his time management and communication going forward.\n\nA month later on April 19th, you touched base with John again on his progress. While he had made some improvements, another key milestone was at risk of delay. You coached John on proactively escalating issues and contingency planning. \n\nFinally, earlier this month on May 8th, you had a post-mortem discussion with John to reflect on learnings from this project. John took accountability for his initial lapses and committed to applying better practices in the future. Overall, while there were significant struggles with this project, you were able to work through them with John and see positive growth in the end. Let me know if you need anything else!",

You see, we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute, and that I couldn't get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis. You know, if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable, then I wouldn't have missed my deadline."

I fully own that I got behind early on and should have communicated challenges I was facing more proactively. The technical issues threw me for a loop but I realize it's my responsibility to adapt and find alternative solutions. I ended up putting in a lot of long nights and weekends to catch up but it was stressful on everyone. For next time, I'm going to plan out my work more thoroughly upfront, sync with teammates early and often, and not be afraid to raise my hand when I'm struggling. This was a good learning experience and I'm committed to applying these lessons going forward."

At the end of the day, we delivered the insights the steering committee was looking for and that's a win. The key now is internalizing these learnings and setting yourself up for success next time around. Keep up the good work and let me know how I can continue to support you."
