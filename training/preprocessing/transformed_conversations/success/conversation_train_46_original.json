    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Emily over the past couple months regarding the conference and related events:\n\nBack in early March, about 2 months ago, you and Emily were planning to attend a conference together at Mister Ewing's request. You decided to take the underground to arrive on time and make a good impression. The conference ended up going well, and the following week, Emily suggested meeting up to discuss potential collaboration opportunities that came out of it. In mid-April, you had a productive brainstorming session and decided to put together a joint proposal. After a few weeks of hard work, you submitted the proposal earlier this month. Just yesterday, Emily excitedly messaged you that the proposal was accepted! Looking back, that initial conference set off a chain of events that has led to an exciting new project for you and Emily to tackle together. It's amazing to see how much has progressed in a relatively short time.",
