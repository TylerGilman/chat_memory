    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Lily regarding her first Christmas in the US and how she's been adjusting since then. \n\nIt all started last Christmas Day, when you wished Lily a Merry Christmas and gave her a thoughtful gift. You explained some American Christmas traditions to her, like decorating the house and singing carols. Then in early January, Lily shared how much she enjoyed her first American Christmas experience with you. \n\nA few weeks later in mid-January, you checked in on how Lily was settling into life in the US. She mentioned some challenges like missing her family back home but appreciated your friendship and support. In February, you invited Lily over to celebrate Chinese New Year together, which she really enjoyed. It helped her feel more at home.\n\nMost recently in June, you met up with Lily and she shared the exciting news that her parents are planning to visit in the fall. She thanked you for being such a good friend and helping her navigate life in a new country over the past 6 months. Overall, it's been great to see Lily gradually adjust to American life and culture with your support, while still cherishing her own traditions and background.",
