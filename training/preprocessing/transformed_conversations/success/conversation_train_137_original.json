    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Jess over the past few months about summer plans and going to the pool. Back in mid-May, you first mentioned that the pool was open for the season. Jess was excited to get a tan in her new bikini, but you explained that as a Taiwanese girl, you prefer to avoid suntans. A week later, you discussed skin cancer risks and SPF in more detail. By Memorial Day weekend, you met up with friends at the pool to kick off summer. Earlier this month, Jess shared that she ended up getting a bit too much sun at the pool and asked for your skincare tips. Most recently last week, you made tentative plans to go shopping together for new sun hats and swimsuit coverups. Overall, your conversations show how your friendship has grown through sharing different perspectives and looking out for each other as you make the most of the summer pool season.",
