    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Tracy over the past couple months:\n\nBack in early June, you had mentioned going on a date with Tracy and possibly seeing a movie. The next day, you let Tracy know you had to go into the studio to work instead of going swimming together. A few weeks later in late June, Tracy reached out again to see if you wanted to get together, and you ended up having a nice dinner and catching up. In mid-July, you invited Tracy to go see a new exhibit at the art museum, which led to a thoughtful discussion about creativity and pursuing passions. Just last week, Tracy messaged you about possibly collaborating on a project together, combining your respective talents. Overall, it seems like your friendship with Tracy has grown deeper over the summer through meaningful shared experiences and discovering common interests.",
