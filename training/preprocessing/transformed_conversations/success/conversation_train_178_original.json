    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Yang Mei regarding her trip to the United States. It all started four months ago in mid-April when Yang Mei first mentioned her upcoming 6-month trip to visit her parents in New Jersey. In your initial conversation, you offered suggestions on ways she could travel around, like by bus or train. \n\nA few weeks later in early May, Yang Mei messaged you excitedly as she was preparing to depart. She had some last minute questions about what to pack and was feeling both nervous and thrilled. Then in late May, about a month into her trip, Yang Mei ran into some complications with her travel plans but was making the best of it and had funny stories to share. \n\nEarlier this summer in mid-June, Yang Mei sent you a long, heartfelt message about how meaningful it's been to reconnect with family and see new places. She thanked you for your travel tips and friendship. Finally, just last week, Yang Mei mentioned she'll be flying back home to China soon in late August. She wants to meet up with you to catch up and share photos and stories from her adventures in America. All in all, it sounds like the trip had its ups and downs but was an incredibly special time for Yang Mei.",
