    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Joe over the past few months regarding your trip to China. It all started back on April 3rd when you first discussed checking in for your flight at the Air China counter. That was over 4 months ago now. A week later on April 10th, Joe followed up to confirm he had all the required travel documents in order. Then in early May, about 3 months ago, you had a long discussion about the itinerary and activities you wanted to do on the trip. Joe seemed really excited. In mid-June, Joe reached out again to talk about packing and other last-minute preparations, since the trip was only a few weeks away at that point. Finally, in late July, just a couple weeks ago, you checked in with each other right before the trip to share contact info and make plans to meet at the airport. Overall, it's been a series of conversations starting with the initial flight check-in discussion spanning all the way through the final pre-trip coordination. Watching the trip come together over the last 4 months has been really cool.",
