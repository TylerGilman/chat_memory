    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the restaurant server over the past few months:\n\nBack in early April, you had ordered a dish at the restaurant but it was significantly delayed in arriving. When you brought this to the server's attention, they apologized, checked with the kitchen, and offered you a complimentary glass of wine for the inconvenience. A week later, you returned to the restaurant and the server remembered you, checking in to make sure your meal came out promptly this time. In May, you had a lengthy conversation with the server, learning their name was Alex and bonding over your shared love of Italian cuisine. Alex gave you some great recommendations for authentic Italian restaurants in the city. Three weeks ago in late June, you returned again and were warmly greeted by Alex, who let you know about a special truffle pasta dish the chef was featuring that evening. You tried it at their suggestion and loved it. Just last Tuesday, you stopped by for a quick lunch and Alex surprised you with a complimentary dessert, saying the chef had prepared extra tiramisu and wanted you to have some. These interactions have turned you into a regular customer who feels welcomed and appreciated at the restaurant.",
