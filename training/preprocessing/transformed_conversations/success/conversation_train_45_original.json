    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Nancy over the past few months regarding her TV watching habits:\n\nIt all started back in early April when you noticed Nancy was glued to her soap operas for hours on end, even during dinner. You suggested she take a break to watch a football match with you instead, but she refused, calling it a \"stupid match\". Tensions rose as you called her selfish for monopolizing the TV. \n\nA few weeks later in late April, you had a serious talk with Nancy about finding a compromise on TV time. She agreed to limit her soap operas to an hour per day so you could watch your documentaries too. However, by mid-May you noticed she was slipping back into her old habits, often sneaking in extra episodes when you weren't around. \n\nThings came to a head in early June when you got into a big argument about her dishonesty and lack of consideration. Nancy finally admitted she had an unhealthy addiction to the melodrama and needed help. You supported her as she talked to a therapist and developed better viewing habits.\n\nNow, as the summer winds down, your relationship is in a much better place. Nancy still enjoys her favorite shows but is no longer consumed by them. She makes an effort to spend more quality time with you and seems genuinely happier overall. Looking back, that first confrontation in April was the wakeup call Nancy needed to make a positive change. Your patience and support made all the difference.",
