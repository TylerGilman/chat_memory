    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Jones regarding the hiring decision between Mary and Jones for the administrative assistant position:\n\nBack in early May, around 2024-05-04, you initially asked Jones to compare Mary and Jones' typing, shorthand and language skills. Jones felt that while Mary typed faster, Jones was more careful, and that Jones' shorthand was quicker but Mary's was the best in her class. When you asked about languages, Jones mentioned that both spoke excellent French, but that Mary's German was more fluent, which you noted was less relevant given the higher volume of French visitors.\n\nThe conversation picked up again a couple weeks later in mid-May when you asked Jones for his hiring recommendation. Jones suggested hiring Mary based on her overall skill set being a better fit. You pushed back, wondering if Jones' typing accuracy and shorthand speed might be more valuable. \n\nAfter a few more exchanges over the next month assessing their relative strengths, Jones sent you a detailed written comparison on 2024-06-22 recommending Mary as the best candidate when considering all factors. You thanked him for the thorough analysis.\n\nThree weeks ago, on 2024-06-25, you informed Jones that after careful consideration, you decided to offer Mary the position. You asked him to let Mary know and begin the onboarding process. Jones congratulated you on the decision and said he would reach out to Mary right away.\n\nOverall, this hiring process took nearly 2 months from early May to late June, with multiple discussions weighing Mary and Jones' qualifications. Jones' input and detailed assessment were valuable in helping you ultimately decide that Mary was the best fit for the administrative assistant role.",
