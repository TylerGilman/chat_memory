    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Jamie over the past few months. It all started back in early February when Jamie first came to see you complaining of a sore throat, headache and fatigue. After examining him, you diagnosed a bad cold and advised a week of bed rest. \n\nTwo weeks later, Jamie returned still feeling unwell. Further tests revealed he had developed bronchitis. You prescribed antibiotics and a nebulizer. By mid-March, Jamie was feeling better overall but still had a lingering cough. You recommended he continue the breathing treatments a bit longer.\n\nIn April, Jamie came in for a follow-up. The cough had resolved but he reported trouble sleeping and focusing at work, likely due to the lengthy illness. You discussed strategies to catch up on rest and manage stress. Jamie missed his next appointment in May, but you ran into him at the store, where he assured you he was doing much better. \n\nEarlier this summer, Jamie scheduled a visit to discuss updated vaccination recommendations for the coming flu season, given his prolonged sickness last winter. That brings us to today. It's been a long road since February, but you've helped guide Jamie back to good health.",
