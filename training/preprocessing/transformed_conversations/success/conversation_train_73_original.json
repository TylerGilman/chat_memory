    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with John over the past few months, Lucy. It all started back on May 2nd when John asked you to relay a message to his wife Mary that he was staying with an old friend since he couldn't get through to her. You agreed and went right over. \n\nThe next day, Mary called you, confused and a bit upset, saying John never came home that night. You tried calling John but couldn't reach him. A couple weeks later in mid-May, John resurfaced and apologized for worrying everyone, explaining he had some personal issues to sort out. \n\nIn early June, you ran into Mary at the store and she confided that things still seemed off with John and she was considering hiring a private investigator. You cautioned her to talk to John first.\n\nBy late July, Mary informed you that John had come clean about struggling with a gambling addiction and they were getting him help. She thanked you for being a good friend through this difficult time.\n\nIt's now mid-August, and while things aren't perfect, it seems John and Mary are on a better path, with open communication and John getting the support he needs. Your friendship and discretion during this challenging chapter meant a lot to them.",
