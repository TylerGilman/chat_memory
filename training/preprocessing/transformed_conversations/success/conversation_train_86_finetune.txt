[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with your student over the past few months regarding homework, calculators and quizzes. Back in early February, you gave the initial homework assignment of reading pages 12-20 and doing exercises 1-10. You clarified students didn't need to type it. You also mentioned they should get calculators and might have a quiz on the day's notes. 

In mid-March, the student followed up asking if the homework was due before or after spring break. You said after break was fine. In April, they had trouble with one of the homework exercises and you walked through it together after class. Most recently last week, the student asked if calculators would be allowed on the upcoming test and you confirmed yes. Overall, the student has been diligent about assignments and you've helped clarify expectations and material when needed.
