    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the watch repair person over the past few months. Back in early April, about three and a half months ago, you first brought your watch in to get the battery replaced after it stopped working. The repair person said they could replace the battery for $5 and have it ready later that day. \n\nYou picked up the watch as planned, but about a month later in mid-May, the watch stopped working again. Frustrated, you brought it back to the shop. After some back and forth, the repair person honored their 1-year guarantee on the battery and replaced it again for free. \n\nHowever, just last month in mid-June, the watch began losing time. Fed up, you returned to the shop again, at which point the repair person suggested the watch movement itself may be damaged, perhaps from the water exposure you had mentioned initially. They quoted you a hefty price for a complete overhaul. After some consideration, you decided it wasn't worth the cost and opted to just keep the watch as-is.\n\nThis whole sequence of events, starting from that initial battery replacement in April up until your decision last month to stick with the malfunctioning watch, spanned about three months in total. While it was frustrating to deal with the recurring issues, at least the repair shop honored their battery guarantee that one time. Moving forward, you'll have to decide if it's time to spring for a new watch altogether.",
