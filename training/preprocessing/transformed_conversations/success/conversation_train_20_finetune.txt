2024-05-12 14:23 | You: How do you put this seat back? I know there is a lever somewhere.
2024-05-12 14:24 | Sarah: What are you doing?
2024-05-12 14:24 | You: I'm getting dressed, what does it look like?
2024-05-12 14:25 | Sarah: It looks like you are about to get dressed. Did you forget we are in a car on the road?
2024-05-12 14:25 | You: I'm good at this. Nobody will see anything.
2024-05-12 14:26 | Sarah: Are you kidding? You're going to cause an accident just from people gawking!
2024-05-12 14:27 | You: All right, pull over at that service station and I'll dress in the ladies'room.
2024-05-12 14:27 | Sarah: That will be my pleasure.
2024-05-19 18:03 | Sarah: Hey, can we talk about what happened in the car last week?
2024-05-19 18:10 | You: Ugh, do we have to? I said I was sorry.
2024-05-19 18:12 | Sarah: I know, but it's important. Changing while I'm driving is super dangerous. You could have caused a serious crash.
2024-05-19 18:15 | You: You're right, it was really dumb of me. I promise I'll never do anything like that again.
2024-05-19 18:17 | Sarah: Thank you, I appreciate that. Your safety is important to me.
2024-06-05 11:31 | You: Remember when I tried to change in the car and you almost murdered me? üòÇ
2024-06-05 11:35 | Sarah: Lol! I mean, can you blame me? I was afraid your lily white butt was going to cause a 10 car pile-up!
2024-06-05 11:36 | You: Hey, I'll have you know my butt is perfectly tanned thank you very much!
2024-06-05 11:37 | Sarah: üôÑ The fact that you almost mooned all of I-95 begs to differ...
2024-07-22 20:48 | Sarah: I was just thinking about how much you've grown up since that car incident a few months ago. I'm really proud of you.
2024-07-22 20:52 | You: Ha, thanks mom. üòâ But seriously, I'm glad we can joke about it now. I was a real idiot.
2024-07-22 20:54 | Sarah: We all make mistakes. The important thing is that you learned from it. I've noticed you being a lot more responsible lately.
2024-07-22 20:55 | You: That's because I have such a great role model. ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks for always looking out for me.
2024-07-22 20:56 | Sarah: Always. That's what best friends are for!
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Sarah over the past few months regarding the car incident back in May. It started on 2024-05-12 when you tried to change clothes while Sarah was driving, nearly causing an accident. Sarah made you wait until the next rest stop. 

Then a week later on 2024-05-19, Sarah brought it up again, lecturing you about car safety. You apologized and promised to be more careful in the future. In early June, around 2024-06-05, you two had a lighthearted exchange joking about the whole thing.

Most recently, just last month on 2024-07-22, Sarah mentioned the incident again, saying how much you've matured since then and that she's proud of you for being more responsible lately. So while it started out as a point of contention, it seems like you've both moved past it and even grown closer as a result. Let me know if you need anything else!
