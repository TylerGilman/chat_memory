    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Mr. Was regarding his new credit card, Lucie. It all started back in early April when you first called him to let him know his new card had arrived. He opted to pick it up in person that same afternoon when meeting with his banker. \n\nA couple weeks later in mid-April, he reached out asking some follow-up questions about the card benefits and features. You had a detailed discussion and he seemed satisfied with the card. However, in early May, he contacted you again as he hadn't received his PIN yet after nearly 3 weeks. You looked into it and got that resolved for him.\n\nThings were quiet for about a month until earlier this month in June when Mr. Was called with concerns about some suspicious charges on his new card. You helped him dispute the charges and ordered him a replacement card as a precaution. Just last week, you touched base again and he confirmed receiving the new card and that all the fraudulent charges were successfully removed. \n\nSo in summary, over the course of these past 2.5 months since he got the card, you've helped Mr. Was activate and start using his card, resolve a delay with his PIN, and unfortunately had to help him deal with some fraudulent activity and get a replacement card. But he seems satisfied with the card and your service overall. Let me know if you need anything else!",
