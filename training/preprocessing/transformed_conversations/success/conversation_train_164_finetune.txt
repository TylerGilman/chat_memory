[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Su over the past couple months:

Back in mid-April, around Su's 7th birthday on April 16th, you had an in-person conversation where she excitedly told you she was turning seven and having a birthday party. You noticed her birthday cake had seven candles. She said she was a big girl now and invited you to come have fun at her party. 

The next day, you followed up via text to wish her a happy birthday again and asked how the party went. She sent you some cute photos and said it was really fun. A few weeks later in early May, Su messaged you out of the blue saying she lost a tooth. You congratulated her and reminisced about the tooth fairy visiting you at that age. 

Then, in mid-May, you checked in to see how she was doing. Su excitedly told you she got a new bike and was learning to ride it. You shared a story about when you learned to ride a bike too. Finally, earlier this month, Su sent you a photo of herself grinning with a gap in her teeth, proudly showing off the space where she lost another tooth. It's been sweet to watch Su growing up and reaching new milestones over these past couple months since her 7th birthday party in April. Let me know if you need anything else!
