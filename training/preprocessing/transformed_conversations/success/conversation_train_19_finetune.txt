[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Dave over the past few months regarding him coming to work with you. It all started back in early April when you initially invited Dave to join your team. After some playful banter, he agreed to come on board. A couple weeks later in mid-April, you two hammered out the specifics of his role and start date. By early May, Dave had begun working with you, but there were some early hiccups in getting him up to speed that required troubleshooting. However, by the end of May, Dave had hit his stride and was making great contributions, which you acknowledged in your one-month check-in. Now, as of today in mid-July, Dave has been working with you for over 2 months and has become an integral part of the team. Overall, despite a few bumps along the way, bringing Dave on board has been a very positive development.
