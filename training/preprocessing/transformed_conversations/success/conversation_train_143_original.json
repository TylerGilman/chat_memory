    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sam over the past couple weeks regarding the cross bakery building. It started about 10 days ago on April 7th when you first asked Sam for directions to the bakery in person. He helpfully explained that you needed to turn around, go 3 blocks to Broadway, turn left, and go 2 more blocks, with the building being between the post office and supermarket. \n\nLater that same day, you messaged Sam to thank him again and let him know you found the building. A few days after that on April 10th, you reached out to Sam again, this time asking if he had any recommendations for what to get at the bakery. He enthusiastically suggested trying their signature cinnamon rolls and mentioned they have great coffee too.\n\nThen just last Friday, April 14th, you messaged Sam one more time to share that you loved the cinnamon rolls he recommended and had been going to the bakery regularly for coffee and pastries all week. You mentioned possibly meeting up there sometime. Sam seemed open to the idea and said to let him know.\n\nSo in summary, over these past 10 days you've gone from getting lost trying to find this bakery to becoming a regular there, all thanks to the initial directions and recommendations Sam provided. Seems like a nice little local spot you've discovered!",
