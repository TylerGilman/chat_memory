    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the moving company representative over the past couple months: \n\nBack in early March, about 2 months ago, you first reached out to the moving company to get a quote for your upcoming move from the 8th floor of your current building to the 6th floor of a building 15 km away. The rep walked you through their pricing structure, which depended on the floor, distance, and amount of furniture. They sent over the contract, which outlined a 50% deposit with the remainder due upon completion. You had some questions about their damage compensation policy, which they clarified.\n\nA few weeks later in late March, you confirmed the moving date and paid the deposit. In mid-April, about a month ago, the movers arrived as scheduled and carefully relocated all your belongings to the new place. You made the final payment and were pleased with the smooth process overall.\n\nLast week, you reached out again to thank them for the great service and leave a positive review. The rep appreciated the feedback. Let me know if you need anything else moving-related in the future!",
