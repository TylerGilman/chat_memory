    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the hotel staff regarding the elevator incident, Person1. It all started nearly two months ago on March 22nd when you and your daughter got stuck in the hotel elevator and had to call for help. The service rep was very responsive and sent assistance right away. Over the following week, you spoke with the hotel manager several times - she was deeply apologetic about the incident and committed to making things right. In early April, about a week and a half after it happened, the manager called to inform you that their investigation found a mechanical failure caused the elevator malfunction. She assured you it was being fixed and offered a complimentary stay as a goodwill gesture, which you appreciated. Then, in a follow-up call later that month, you had a nice chat with her and felt the hotel had handled everything properly in the end, restoring your confidence as a guest. All in all, while getting stuck in the elevator with your daughter was a scary experience in the moment, the hotel staff responded swiftly, communicated transparently, and took steps to resolve the underlying issue and make amends over the past 7 weeks since the March 22 incident.",
