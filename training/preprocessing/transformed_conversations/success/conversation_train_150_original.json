    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Li over the past few months, Mei. It all started back in early April when you two went hiking together near Guilin and had that amazing conversation admiring the scenic views and wildlife. Li spotted a rare bird through your binoculars which kicked off her interest in birdwatching. \n\nOver the next couple months, you two kept in touch, sharing photos and tips about hiking spots and nature sightings. In mid-May, Li excitedly messaged you about getting her own binoculars and bird guidebook. A few weeks later in early June, you had a long chat about your upcoming hiking plans for the summer and Li shared that birdwatching had become a serious hobby.\n\nThen just last month, Li reached out about a rare bird migration coming through Guilin in July. You made plans to hike together again which you did this past weekend on July 13th. Li was so knowledgeable and pointed out all sorts of amazing birds. Afterwards, you two grabbed dinner and reflected on how far her passion and expertise had come in just a few short months since that first fateful hike in April. It's been really special seeing Li discover this new passion and being able to share it together in the beautiful nature around Guilin.",
