    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the restaurant server over the past several months:\n\nBack in early February, you had a conversation with the server about the daily specials and ended up ordering the red cooked sea cucumber, assorted cold dishes, and champagne. A couple weeks later in mid-February, you checked in to see if they had any Valentine's Day specials. Then in early April, you made a reservation for your anniversary dinner. The server helped you plan a special multi-course meal with wine pairings.  \n\nIn mid-May, you stopped by for a quick solo lunch and the server remembered your usual order. Then in late June, you had an extended discussion about the restaurant's plans to expand the outdoor patio seating for the summer. Most recently, just last week, you made another reservation for a business dinner next month and worked with the server to create a prix fixe menu for your guests.\n\nOver these past 6 months, you've developed a friendly rapport with this server, who now knows your preferences well. The restaurant has become your go-to for both special occasions and regular visits. Let me know if you need anything else!",
