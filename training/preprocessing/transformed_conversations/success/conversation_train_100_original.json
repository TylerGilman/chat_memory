    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the cable company representative regarding your ongoing cable issues. It all started back on April 3rd when you first reached out about your cable being out. The rep apologized and said it should be fixed in a couple days, and that you wouldn't be charged while it was down. \n\nHowever, two weeks later on April 17th, you followed up since the issue still wasn't resolved. The rep again apologized profusely and escalated the issue, promising an update within 48 hours. True to their word, on April 19th they got back to you saying a technician would be out the following Tuesday, April 23rd, to diagnose and fix the problem.\n\nThe technician visit on the 23rd unfortunately didn't fully resolve things. While your cable was restored, you noticed intermittent outages and poor picture quality over the next month. Fed up, you reached back out to the rep on May 28th expressing your frustration. They offered a substantial credit to your account for the 2 months of spotty service and scheduled another technician visit for May 31st.\n\nThat brings us to today, August 15th. It's been over two months since that last technician came out on May 31st and comprehensively resolved your cable issues. The rep followed up in mid-June to confirm things were still working well. You've been enjoying uninterrupted, quality cable service for about 10 weeks now. Quite the ordeal but I'm glad they made things right in the end and that you've been problem-free for nearly 3 months! Let me know if any other cable issues crop up and I'll be happy to jump in and help resolve them quickly.",
