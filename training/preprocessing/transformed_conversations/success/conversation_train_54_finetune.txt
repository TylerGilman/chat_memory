2024-02-05 14:32 | You: Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms.
2024-02-05 14:33 | Javier: I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents.
2024-02-05 14:35 | You: I fully understand your position. An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time. But, on the other hand it would add to the buying costs. We've been, after all, trading partners for 3 years and you know us well. Can't you give us D / A or D / P?
2024-02-05 14:37 | Javier: I'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by L / C.
2024-02-05 14:39 | You: But on our part, our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports. And there is the licensing problem.
2024-02-05 14:41 | Javier: I understand that. Still, I'm not in a position to help you. Maybe we could do something later when we have had more and larger deals together.
2024-02-22 09:15 | You: Hi Javier, I wanted to follow up on our discussion about payment terms from a few weeks ago. As I mentioned, the L/C requirement poses some licensing challenges on our end. Is there any flexibility at all on your side? We'd really like to find a way to make this work.
2024-03-08 17:03 | Javier: Hi Person1, apologies for the delayed response. I discussed this internally and unfortunately our policy is quite firm on the L/C at this stage of our relationship. I agree it would be great to find a solution. Perhaps we can revisit this after a few more successful transactions together to build that trust and history. Let's keep the dialogue open.
2024-05-06 11:30 | You: It was great to meet again in person, Javier. I'm encouraged by what you shared about potentially having some flexibility on payment terms for trusted partners. As we discussed, here is our specific proposal for the next shipment: [proposal details]. Please let me know if this seems feasible on your end. We're eager to find a way forward.
2024-06-12 15:47 | You: Hi Javier, I just wanted to check in on the proposal I sent over in May regarding the payment terms for our next order. I know you likely need some time for internal discussions. Please let me know if you need any other information from me. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.
2024-08-02 13:29 | Javier: Dear Person1, I'm terribly sorry for my delayed reply. I really appreciate your patience. We carefully considered your proposal and discussed it at length internally. Unfortunately, we aren't able to make an exception to our L/C policy at this time, even for a valued partner like yourself. I know this isn't the news you were hoping for. Please know that we greatly value our business relationship and are committed to finding mutually beneficial solutions as we continue to work together and build trust. I'm confident we'll get there with time. Let's keep the lines of communication open.
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Javier regarding your business negotiations, Person1. Your initial face-to-face meeting about payment terms took place in early February. You requested more favorable terms like D/A or D/P, but Javier insisted on L/C, citing their standard practices. 

A few weeks later in late February, you followed up over email, reiterating the licensing challenges on your end. In March, Javier responded that his hands were tied for now but suggested revisiting terms after a few more successful deals together. 

In early May, you met again in person and Javier shared that his company might have some flexibility on a case-by-case basis for trusted partners. Hopeful, you emailed him a specific proposal in late May. After a few weeks with no response, you checked in again in mid-June.

Finally, earlier this month in August, Javier got back to you apologetically. He explained that after further internal discussions, they decided they couldn't budge on the L/C requirement yet. However, he reiterated his desire to continue working together and building trust. 

As of today, August 15, 2024, the payment terms remain an obstacle but the door seems open to revisiting the discussion after more successful transactions. The progression from Javier's initial hard stance to showing some flexibility and desire to find a mutually agreeable solution in the future seems promising for your business relationship.
