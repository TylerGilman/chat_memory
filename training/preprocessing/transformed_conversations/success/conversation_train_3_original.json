    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with John over the past few months regarding his girlfriend and upcoming marriage:\n\nBack in early March, you first found out John had a girlfriend when you confronted him about not telling you. He apologized but seemed to think it wasn't a big deal. This led to a heated argument. In the following weeks, you had some brief exchanges where he shared a few more details, but you were still upset about being kept in the dark. \n\nThen in late April, John casually mentioned they were engaged, which completely blindsided you. How could your close friend not tell you something so monumental? You had a long, emotional conversation about your friendship. Over the next couple months, John tried to repair things by opening up more - he told you how he proposed in May, shared their wedding plans in June, and even asked you to be a groomsman in July. While you appreciated his efforts, you still felt hurt by his initial secrecy. \n\nEarlier this month, you met his fianc\u00e9e for the first time. Seeing them together and how happy John is has softened you considerably. With their fall wedding approaching, you're doing your best to be supportive, despite the rockiness of the past few months. John is still one of your oldest friends, after all. You're working on fully forgiving him and focusing on celebrating this exciting next chapter in his life.",
