    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Katie Thomas over the past several months, Paul. It all started back on March 15th when you first interviewed the 18-year-old Katie for a temporary office position. While initially hesitant due to her age and lack of experience, you were impressed by her technical skills in word processing and decided to give her a chance.\n\nIn the months that followed, Katie proved herself to be a quick learner and hard worker. In early April, you checked in and she shared how well she was adapting to the office systems. However, by late May some issues arose with her accidentally deleting an important file. You had a serious discussion about protocols and attention to detail.  \n\nThings improved in June, with Katie putting in extra hours to make up for her earlier mistake. In mid-July, you had a lengthy chat about her college plans and how this work experience would serve her well. Just last week, Katie told you she got into her top choice school. You congratulated her and discussed wrapping up her time at the office.\n\nOverall, despite some early challenges, Katie ended up being a solid temporary employee who developed valuable skills over her 5 months with the company. Her eagerness to learn and strong work ethic served her well. You played an important mentorship role and helped guide her early professional development before she heads off to college later this month.",
