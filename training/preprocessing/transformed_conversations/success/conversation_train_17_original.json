    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sarah regarding her triplets over the past few months:\n\nBack in early June, you ran into Sarah and her triplets for the first time and complimented how healthy and adorable they looked, noting their resemblance to Sarah and John. When you asked if they planned to have more kids, an exhausted Sarah said she was already at her limit, with many sleepless nights while John slept through the babies' crying. You encouraged her that it will all be worth it in the long run. \n\nA week later in mid-June, Sarah reached out to vent more about her struggles adjusting to triplets. You lent a sympathetic ear and shared some advice from your own parenting experience. In early July, Sarah messaged again sounding more positive, sharing a cute story about the triplets starting to giggle and interact more. You celebrated this milestone together.\n\nLater in July, Sarah had a difficult week when all three babies got sick at once. You checked in often, offered to bring over supplies or watch the triplets for a bit, and helped keep her spirits up. Last week in early August, you met up with Sarah and the triplets at the park. The babies looked so much bigger and Sarah seemed more at ease in her role as a mom of triplets. You were happy to see how far they've come this summer. Becoming a parent to triplets is a massive life change, but Sarah is adapting impressively well with support from you and others.",
