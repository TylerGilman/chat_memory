2024-05-03 09:02 | Yang Mei: Hey there! Just wanted to check in before I head to the airport later today. Feeling excited but also a bit nervous!
2024-05-03 09:10 | You: That's totally normal. You're going to have an amazing time! Let me know if any last minute questions come up.
2024-05-03 09:15 | Yang Mei: Actually, I was wondering - do you think I need to pack a heavy coat? Not sure what the weather will be like.
2024-05-03 09:18 | You: In May, the Northeast U.S. can still be quite cool, especially at night. I'd bring a medium weight jacket just in case.
2024-05-03 09:22 | Yang Mei: Got it, I'll throw one in. Thanks! Boarding soon so may be out of touch, but I'll update you when I can :)
2024-05-03 09:25 | You: Sounds good, safe travels! Looking forward to hearing about your adventures.

2024-05-28 20:47 | You: Oh no, what happened? Is everything okay?
2024-05-28 20:52 | Yang Mei: All good now, but we had some crazy travel snafus in the beginning. Trains were delayed, buses broke down...
2024-05-28 20:54 | Yang Mei: At one point grandma and I were stranded at a tiny bus station in the middle of nowhere for hours!
2024-05-28 20:56 | You: Oh wow, that sounds stressful. I'm glad you made it through! Guess public transit isn't always reliable.
2024-05-28 21:01 | Yang Mei: Definitely an adventure! On the upside, we met so many kind strangers who helped us out along the way.
2024-05-28 21:03 | Yang Mei: Anyway, just wanted to share a few of the funnier stories. Miss you and the rest of the gang back home!
