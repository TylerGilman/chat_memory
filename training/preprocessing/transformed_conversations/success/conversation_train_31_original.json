    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the leather jacket customer over the past few months. It all started back on May 3rd when they came into the store looking for a size 40 leather jacket. You helped them decide on a black one and they also ended up buying a pure silk dress on your recommendation. \n\nA week later on May 10th, they messaged to say how much they loved the jacket but had a question about caring for the silk dress. You gave some helpful tips. Then in mid-June, about a month after the initial purchase, they reached out again wanting to exchange the jacket for a brown one instead. After some back and forth, you arranged the exchange.\n\nThree weeks ago in late July, they messaged again to rave about how much they love both the jacket and dress and to thank you for the excellent service. They mentioned referring a friend to the store. And just last Tuesday, the friend came in and said the customer had sent them. The friend also bought a leather jacket on your recommendation.\n\nAll in all, what started as a simple jacket purchase turned into repeat business and a referral over the course of 3 months, showing the impact of your attentive customer service and good product recommendations. The customer clearly trusts your judgment and has been really satisfied with the items. Nice work building that relationship!",
