    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the job candidate over the past few months:\n\nBack in early April, you conducted an initial interview with the candidate where they expressed interest in a management role and shared their 3 years of relevant experience. The candidate seemed ambitious and had a plan to work their way up in the company if hired. \n\nA week later, you followed up requesting their resume and references, which they promptly provided. Their qualifications looked solid. In early May, you scheduled a second interview to dive deeper into their management style and approach to challenges. The discussion went well and gave you confidence in their leadership potential.\n\nAfter discussing with the hiring committee, you reached out in late May to inform them they made it to the final round and to schedule a half-day on-site interview. That took place in mid-June and included a presentation and panel interviews which they handled impressively. \n\nEarlier this month, after finalizing the offer details, you called to congratulate them on getting the job, and they excitedly accepted. You sent the formal offer letter that day and they returned the signed copy within 48 hours. \n\nYesterday, you checked in to confirm their start date of August 5th and shared how much the team is looking forward to having them join. Overall it's been a smooth and positive hiring process over these past 3.5 months and you feel great about the candidate you and the team selected.",
