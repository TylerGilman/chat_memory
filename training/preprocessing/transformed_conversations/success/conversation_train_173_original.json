    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the store employee over the past few months. Back on February 12th, you went into the store and purchased a pair of pants. You inquired about their return policy and the employee explained that you could bring them back within 7 days for a full refund, and that they also offer free alterations. You paid $70 by credit card.\n\nTwo weeks later on February 26th, you messaged them asking if the 7-day return policy could be extended as you had been out of town. They made an exception and allowed you to return the pants for a full refund when you got back. \n\nThen in mid-March, you contacted them again to take them up on the free alterations offer. You brought the pants in on March 16th and they hemmed them for you at no charge.\n\nMost recently, on April 30th, about three weeks ago, you messaged them with some follow-up questions about caring for the pants, and they provided helpful laundering instructions to keep them looking their best.\n\nOverall, it's been a very positive customer service experience across multiple interactions over the past three months. They've been flexible with their policies, provided the alterations as promised, and continued to be responsive to your questions. Let me know if you need anything else!",
