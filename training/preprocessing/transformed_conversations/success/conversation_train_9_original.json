    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Alex regarding your visa application process over the past several months:\n\nBack in early February, about 6 months ago, you ran into Alex near the visa office when you were heading in for one of your interviews. Alex helpfully showed you the way and you had a brief conversation about your plans to study English Literature abroad. \n\nA month later in March, Alex messaged to check in on how your visa process was going. You shared that you had completed a couple more interviews but were still waiting on a decision. In April, 3 months ago, you excitedly let Alex know that your student visa had been conditionally approved, pending submission of a few final documents and your acceptance letter.\n\nAs you worked to get everything in order, you and Alex texted a bit less frequently, with just a couple quick exchanges in May about gathering all the required paperwork. Then in mid-June, only 2 months back, you messaged with the great news that your visa had been officially approved and you would be able to go abroad to study in the fall.\n\nSince then, you and Alex have chatted a handful of times about your preparations, with a longer conversation a few weeks ago in late July to catch up on the details of your move. And just last week, you sent a message thanking Alex again for his help and support throughout this months-long process.\n\nSo in summary, what started as a chance encounter back in February when Alex helped you find the visa office, has turned into a friendship over the past half year as Alex has followed along with your visa journey, from the early interviews, to the conditional approval, final submission, and now preparing for your exciting studies abroad starting next month.",
