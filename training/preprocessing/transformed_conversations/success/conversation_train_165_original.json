    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the librarian, Sarah, over the past several months: \n\nYou first met Sarah in person at the university library back on January 15th when you asked for her help getting oriented, having just arrived from China to begin your mathematics graduate program. Although she was busy that day, you reconnected that same afternoon and she gave you an extensive tour, patiently answering all your questions.\n\nA week later, you followed up via text to thank her again and ask a few more questions that had come up as you started using the library regularly for your studies. She responded promptly with helpful guidance. \n\nIn early March, around midterms, you texted Sarah in a panic, unable to access some critical online resources for a research paper. She called you and calmly walked you through troubleshooting the technical issues.\n\nThen in mid-April, you stopped by Sarah's office to excitedly share that your paper had been accepted to a prestigious conference. She congratulated you warmly and you made plans to grab coffee to celebrate.\n\nYour coffee chat in late April was filled with stimulating conversation about your shared academic interests. Sarah mentioned a project she was working on and you offered some insights from your research that she found valuable. \n\nAfter you returned from the conference in late May, you sent Sarah a detailed email sharing what you'd learned and thanking her again for all her support. She replied that it was her pleasure and said she looked forward to hearing more as your studies progressed.\n\nEarlier this summer, in mid-June, you consulted Sarah again as you were exploring potential thesis topics. Her knowledge of the library's resources helped you identify some promising areas to pursue.\n\nA month ago, in mid-July, you and Sarah met up for lunch and had a great conversation about new developments in your field, her upcoming library initiatives, and your potential thesis direction. You both expressed appreciation for the mentoring relationship and friendship that has developed.\n\nSo in summary, over the past 7 months, you've gone from being strangers to developing a meaningful connection as Sarah has consistently supported you in getting oriented to the library and navigating your graduate studies. What began as a simple request for a library tour has blossomed into an enriching ongoing dialogue about your shared intellectual interests. Her guidance has meaningfully contributed to your academic success and personal growth during this critical first year of your program.",
