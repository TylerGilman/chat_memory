    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Tom over the past few months regarding hiking and your developing friendship. It all started back in early February when you first discussed weekend plans and Tom invited you to join his hike in the southern Rocky Mountains. You ended up going on that initial 3-day, 30-mile hike together, which was a great bonding experience. \n\nIn the months that followed, you kept in touch regularly, with a mix of quick check-ins about your weeks and longer conversations diving deeper into your shared love of hiking and the outdoors. Tom opened up about how hiking helped him deal with stress and find peace. You shared stories of your most memorable wildlife encounters on the trails.\n\nAs spring arrived, you started planning a longer hiking trip together for later in the summer. There were a few logistical hurdles to figure out in the planning, but you worked through them together. In May, Tom had to deal with a family emergency that put the trip in question, but fortunately everything turned out okay. The challenges brought you closer together as friends.\n\nNow, in mid-August, you're in the final stages of preparation for the big week-long hike that's coming up in just a few days. Looking back over the past 6 months, it's remarkable to see how your friendship with Tom has deepened through your shared passion for hiking and hours of trail conversations. What started as a casual weekend invitation has grown into a cherished friendship. As you get ready to embark on this next outdoor adventure together, you feel grateful for the bond you've built and excited for the experiences and conversations to come.",
