    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Lilly over the past couple months, starting from when you reconnected in early January. After catching up about your winter holidays in that first conversation, you met up for coffee the following week to chat more. Lilly shared photos from her recent travels and you recommended some of the books you had read. A few weeks later in early February, Lilly messaged asking for advice on a trip she was planning for the spring. You had a long discussion sharing travel tips and experiences. Then just last week, Lilly excitedly told you she had booked the trip and invited you to join for part of it. While you weren't able to take time off work, you were happy she followed through on planning it and wished her well. It's been nice rekindling your friendship with Lilly these past couple months, from the initial catch-up to now having such meaningful conversations and sharing in her excitement about this upcoming adventure.",
