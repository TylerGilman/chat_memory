    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Mrs. Turnbull regarding your son Jack over the past several months:\n\nYour first conversation with Mrs. Turnbull about Jack's school routine happened back in early February. Since then, you've had a number of check-ins and more detailed discussions. In March, you shared that Jack was struggling with the workload and considering quitting the football team. By late April, he had decided to stick with it, and his grades were improving. In May, Mrs. Turnbull mentioned her grandson was having some issues at school too, and you were able to offer advice from your experience with Jack. Earlier this summer in June, you ran into each other at the park and she asked how Jack's summer was going - he was enjoying the break but looking forward to school starting again. Your most recent chat was just last week, where you updated her that Jack is excited to start high school in a few weeks. Overall, it's been really nice to have Mrs. Turnbull to talk to about parenting and school stuff these past 6 months. Her grandson and Jack are around the same age, so she understands what you're going through and always offers a supportive ear and helpful perspective.",
