    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sarah about finding a place to rent near the university. Back in early June, about two and a half months ago, you and Sarah first discussed what kind of place to look for. You agreed proximity to campus was key so you could sleep in later. A smaller, affordable place was fine, ideally quieter for studying. \n\nThe next day, you went to the estate agent together to see the options. Then in mid-June, Sarah found a promising listing and you scheduled a viewing. When you saw it in person, it looked perfect - a cozy 1-bedroom within walking distance in a peaceful neighborhood. The rent was \u00a3550/month, pricier than the \u00a3100 you'd originally hoped for, but reasonable split between two. \n\nAfter moving forward with the application, there was an anxious two-week wait. Finally, in early July, great news - your application was approved! Over the past month, you've been coordinating with Sarah on moving logistics, buying essentials, and getting settled in before classes start in September. It's been a hectic summer, but you're excited to begin this new chapter in the ideal flat for you both.",
