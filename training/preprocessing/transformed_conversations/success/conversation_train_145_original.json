    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Alex regarding the research project on Asian countries that your professor assigned back in late April. About four months ago, you first mentioned the project to Alex, sharing that you had to gather information on cultural customs and holidays in just 3 days. Alex initially thought they could help, but when you quizzed them, it became clear they didn't have the knowledge you needed. \n\nOver the next few weeks in May, you continued working diligently on the project. You shared some interesting facts you learned with Alex, who was supportive but couldn't contribute much. By late May, with the deadline looming, stress was setting in. Alex tried to cheer you up and suggested some online resources that ended up being quite helpful.\n\nThe project wrapped up in early June and you got great feedback from your professor. Alex was happy for you and glad they could provide a bit of moral support and resource suggestions, even if they couldn't help with the content itself. The experience brought you closer as friends. In the couple months since then, you've had a few conversations referencing back to that intense project period and how it turned out to be a rewarding growth experience.",
