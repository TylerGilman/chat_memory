    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Tom Hanks regarding his mother's flower delivery, Shareen. It all started about a month and a half ago on June 1st when Tom first called to place an order for a dozen long-stem red carnations to be delivered to his mother's apartment on June 17th. You took down all the details and processed his Visa payment. \n\nThe delivery went smoothly and his mother loved the flowers. Tom called back the next week to thank you personally. Then in early July, about two weeks ago, Tom reached out again wanting to send another bouquet for his mother's birthday on July 30th. This time he requested an assortment of summer flowers in bright colors.\n\nLast week, you followed up with Tom to confirm the birthday flower delivery details. Everything was on track. Then yesterday, Tom's assistant Angela called to add a box of gourmet chocolates to the birthday order. She said Tom wanted to make sure this birthday was extra special.\n\nSo in summary, over the past month and a half you've helped Tom send two lovely flower arrangements to brighten his mother's day - carnations in mid-June, and a colorful summer bouquet with chocolates for her late July birthday. Your attention to detail and personal customer service have made Tom a very satisfied loyal customer. Great job, Shareen!",
