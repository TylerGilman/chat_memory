    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the helpful stranger who assisted you in finding your lost keys, which began about two weeks ago in early May. The initial face-to-face encounter occurred on May 3rd when the kind individual readily agreed to help search for your missing keys, which they successfully located. \n\nYou followed up the next day to express your deep gratitude again via text. They reiterated that it was no trouble at all and they were happy to help. This led to some friendly back-and-forth over the next few days as you got to know each other a bit.\n\nLast Tuesday, May 14th, you reached out to share that the keychain had actually been a gift from your late grandfather, making their recovery even more meaningful. The stranger was touched that you shared something so personal and said they felt it was meant to be that your paths crossed that day. \n\nYour most recent exchange was yesterday, where you mentioned hoping to pay forward the kindness they showed you. They said your heartfelt appreciation was more than enough. Overall, it's been a really nice example of the goodwill that still exists between people, even in brief interactions with strangers. The whole experience clearly meant a lot to you.",
