    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Alex over the past few months about 19th century European art books. It started back in early March when Alex first asked for your help locating a specific collection. You were able to point them to the right book in the library that day. A couple weeks later, Alex reached out again to share how much they were enjoying the book and to ask for recommendations on similar works. This kicked off an ongoing exchange throughout the spring and summer. In April, you had an in-depth discussion comparing different art movements of the era. Then in June, Alex excitedly told you they were planning a trip to Europe to see some of the actual paintings in person. Last month, you shared personal stories about your own experiences visiting European art museums. And just last week, Alex sent photos from their trip, expressing gratitude for your help and conversations that deepened their appreciation for the art. It's been really rewarding to connect with Alex and mutually explore this passion over the past 5 months.",
