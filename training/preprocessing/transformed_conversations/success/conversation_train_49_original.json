    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the candidate over the past couple months regarding their college leadership experience and extracurricular activities:\n\nBack in early March, you had an initial interview conversation where the candidate mentioned serving as Propaganda department minister at their university, though they didn't receive any honors or awards. They also played on the basketball team. \n\nA few weeks later in late March, you followed up to ask for more details on their leadership role. They explained some of their key responsibilities and initiatives. In mid-April, the candidate reached out proactively to share a relevant leadership article they had come across, sparking an insightful discussion.\n\nMost recently last week, you touched base again and the candidate reflected on how their college leadership and athletic experiences shaped their teamwork, communication and organizational skills - key strengths they would bring to this role. Overall, these conversations have given you helpful context on the candidate's background and qualifications over the past two months.",

I also made sure to celebrate wins and give credit where due. It was fulfilling to see shy first-years really come out of their shells and become confident leaders in their own right."

Collaborating with my peers on the student council taught me so much about effective communication, while basketball ingrained the importance of being a team player. I honed my organizational skills juggling multiple priorities. Perhaps most importantly, both experiences instilled a strong work ethic and ability to motivate myself and others towards a common goal. I believe these qualities would enable me to thrive in the role and add value to your team."
