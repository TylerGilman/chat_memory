    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Mike over the past few months: Back in early May, you excitedly told Mike about the new dress you bought for $70, a great bargain, to wear for your school talk. He complimented how you looked in it. A few days later, Mike had his accident and was hospitalized. You checked in on his condition regularly, and in early June he was finally discharged to recover at home. You visited him there, continuing your tradition of weekly movie nights but watching at his place so he could rest. By late June, Mike had recovered enough to go out to the movies again, and you celebrated by splurging on snacks. Just last week, you reminisced together about how far he's come since the accident. The whole experience brought you closer as friends and made you appreciate having each other to rely on.",
