    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sarah over the past few months about your upcoming trip to Hawaii. Back in early May, you first mentioned to Sarah how excited you were to visit Hawaii for the first time, but expressed concern about finding your way around. She immediately offered to show you around when you arrived. \n\nIn mid-June, about two months ago, you reached out again to start planning specifics. Sarah suggested some must-see spots and you worked out the details of when she could meet up with you. Then last month, you had a longer discussion where Sarah shared some of her favorite lesser-known beaches and hikes. She also helped you book a snorkeling excursion.\n\nYour most recent exchange was last week, where you confirmed your arrival details and Sarah said she's looking forward to playing tour guide. She mentioned having a special first-day adventure planned for you. Overall, Sarah has gone out of her way to make you feel at ease about your first Hawaii trip and it sounds like you have an exciting time ahead, with a knowledgeable local friend to show you the ropes!",
