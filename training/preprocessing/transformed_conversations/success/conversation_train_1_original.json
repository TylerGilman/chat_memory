    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Mrs. Parker over the past few months regarding Ricky's vaccinations. The initial visit on April 12th went smoothly, with Ricky receiving several key vaccines and you scheduling followups for the remaining doses. However, in early May, Mrs. Parker expressed concerns about potential side effects, which you addressed thoroughly in a detailed exchange. After Ricky received his next round of shots later that month, Mrs. Parker reached out in June worried about a mild fever, but you reassured her it was a normal immune response. Finally, earlier this month, Ricky completed his 14-month vaccine series and Mrs. Parker thanked you for the attentive care throughout the process. These conversations underscore the importance of clear provider-parent communication to ensure timely vaccinations and address common concerns that arise.",
