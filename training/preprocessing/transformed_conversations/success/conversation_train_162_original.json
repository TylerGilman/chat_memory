    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Frank over the past few months regarding Janet Check. It all started back in early April when you first saw Janet at some event and commented to Frank about how she really knows how to \"strut her stuff.\" Frank was quite taken with her looks as well. A couple weeks later in mid-April, you discussed how wealthy her father is and how that allows Janet to always dress so well. Frank still thought she was the most beautiful woman around. \n\nIn early May, the topic of Janet came up again in comparison to your mutual acquaintance Kate. You both readily agreed that Janet is far more attractive. The conversations died down for a bit after that. Then in mid-June, Frank mentioned he ran into Janet at a charity function and they really hit it off. He seemed quite smitten. However, by early July he confided in you that things had cooled off with Janet and he was feeling a bit down about it. You commiserated and suggested maybe it was for the best.\n\nNow today, August 17th, as I review your message history, it seems Janet hasn't come up in conversation for over a month now. It was an interesting few months back in the spring and early summer as you and Frank discussed this alluring woman who captured Frank's eye for a time. But as these things often go, Frank's infatuation eventually ran its course. Let me know if you need anything else!",
