    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sarah over the past few months regarding her job application and onboarding at your company. It all started back in early May when you first interviewed Sarah and she impressed you with her prior sales experience and regional connections in the Northeast that could boost sales. A couple weeks later in mid-May, you reached out to let her know she got the job, and she enthusiastically accepted. \n\nIn early June, about a month after the interview, Sarah had some onboarding questions that you helped clarify. Then in late June, you checked in and she mentioned she was settling in well and excited to be taking on her first sales trip. Fast forward to late July, about two months after she started, and Sarah shared the great news that she had closed a major deal on that first trip, which you congratulated her on. \n\nIt's now been three months since Sarah joined the team, and it seems she is already making a real impact and thriving in the role, just as her interview had indicated. Her prior experience, regional knowledge, and enthusiasm are proving to be major assets. You're excited to see her continued growth and contributions.",
