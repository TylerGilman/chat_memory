[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with John over the past few months regarding his girlfriend and upcoming marriage:

Back in early March, you had a heated face-to-face conversation with John where you confronted him about not telling you he had a girlfriend he was in love with and planning to marry. You felt betrayed that he kept this from you. The next day, you followed up over text to reiterate your frustration. John apologized and said he should have told you sooner. 

A few weeks later in late March, you met up for coffee and John opened up more, explaining how he had been nervous to tell you since things had moved quickly with his girlfriend Sarah. You appreciated his honesty and felt your friendship was back on track. Then in mid-April, John excitedly texted you that he and Sarah had gotten engaged. While still processing the news, you congratulated him.

Just last week, you had a long phone call with John diving deeper into the details of his engagement and upcoming wedding. He asked you to be a groomsman which touched you deeply. The journey from feeling betrayed to now supporting your best friend's marriage has been quite a rollercoaster these past two months. But you're happy John is following his heart and including you in this next chapter.
