    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Judy Liao regarding her job application, going back to early spring:\n\nJudy first came into the office to inquire about her application for the accounts assistant position on March 15th. You confirmed receipt of her resume and supporting documents. About two weeks later, on March 29th, you reached out to schedule an interview. The interview took place on April 10th and went well overall. You informed Judy she was a top candidate and would hear back within a week. However, the hiring decision was delayed, so you provided an update on April 24th that the process was taking longer than expected. After another two weeks, on May 8th, you called Judy to offer her the position, which she happily accepted. Her start date was set for June 1st. Now, over a month into her employment, you checked in with Judy earlier today, July 18th, and she expressed how much she is enjoying the role so far.",
