    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the guest in room 512 regarding their faulty air conditioner, dating back to early February of this year. The initial call about the broken AC came in on February 3rd. You promptly sent a maintenance team to assess and repair the unit that same day. \n\nHowever, the issue resurfaced a couple weeks later in mid-February. The guest called again on the 16th, frustrated that the AC had stopped working properly once more. Your team made another repair attempt, but unfortunately the unit malfunctioned yet again by early March. \n\nRealizing more extensive work was needed, in mid-March you arranged for the guest to temporarily move to a different room while your team fully replaced the old AC over the course of a week. The guest was appreciative of this, despite the inconvenience.\n\nAfter the new unit was installed in late March, things were fine for a while. But unexpectedly, the guest reached out again in early June, reporting strange noises coming from the new AC. Your team promptly investigated and made some adjustments, resolving the problem.\n\nThe guest thanked you for the consistently prompt service throughout this prolonged AC saga when you checked in with them last month, in mid-July, to ensure everything was still working properly. It's been a long road since that first call nearly 6 months ago in February, but your attentive customer service has helped maintain a positive relationship with this guest despite the recurring AC challenges in room 512.",
