    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Liz over the past couple months about parasols and sun protection. It started back on June 12th when you were surprised to see her carrying an umbrella on a hot sunny day. She explained how she uses it as a parasol to avoid getting sunburned, and shared an interesting fact about umbrellas originally being invented in China for sun protection. \n\nA few weeks later in early July, you noticed her parasol had a beautiful cherry blossom design and complimented it. She told you how it's one of her favorite Japanese patterns. In mid-July, you ran into Liz at the park and she showed you the portable sun shade tent she bought for extra protection during picnics. You were impressed by her commitment to sun safety.\n\nThen just last week, Liz messaged you excitedly about a new UV-blocking parasol she ordered online with a lovely lotus flower pattern. She said it offers even better sun protection than a regular umbrella. Overall, your conversations have given you a much greater appreciation for parasols as a functional fashion accessory and the importance of preventing sun damage. Liz's knowledge and enthusiasm about the topic has been enlightening.",
