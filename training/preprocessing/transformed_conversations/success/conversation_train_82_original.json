    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Myra over the past few months regarding her issues at school. It started back in early April when you first heard that Myra's teacher had criticized her in front of the whole class for cheating and being rude. You discussed it with her and expressed that her rudeness was inexcusable, even if she was angry. \n\nA couple weeks later in mid-April, Myra confided in you that she was struggling in that class and felt the teacher had it out for her. You encouraged her to talk to the teacher respectfully. Then in early May, Myra told you the teacher embarrassed her again for a low test score, and she skipped class the next day, leading to detention. You urged her to apologize and commit to doing better.\n\nThings seemed to improve for a few weeks, but in late May, Myra admitted she was caught cheating again and might face suspension. Worried about the escalating situation, you had a long talk with her last week in early June about turning things around. You offered to help her study and prepare for an important upcoming exam. \n\nThe most recent development was just a few days ago, when Myra excitedly told you she aced the exam fairly and thanked you for your support. It seems like your mentoring and encouragement over these difficult months has really helped Myra start getting back on track academically and behaviorally. Hopefully this positive trend continues! Let me know if you need anything else.",
