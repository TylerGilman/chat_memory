    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Bob regarding your sister Amy's return from the states and planning a party for her:\n\nTwo months ago on March 15th, you first got in touch with Bob to let him know Amy was coming back the following weekend. He immediately suggested getting together that night to plan a party. A couple days later on the 17th, you met up and started brainstorming ideas. In early April, about a month and a half ago, you finalized the party details together. Then last week, you touched base again to confirm everything was set. The party ended up being a huge success this past weekend! Amy was thrilled by the surprise welcome home celebration you and Bob put together.",
