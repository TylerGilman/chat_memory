    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Edward over the past few months regarding book sharing on the subway. It all started back in early April when Edward first excitedly told you about seeing books left on the subway for people to read. You thought it was a nice idea for sharing but reminded him to be mindful of placement. A week later, Edward messaged you saying he left one of his own books and noticed someone reading it, which made him happy. In early May, you asked for an update and he said the book sharing had really taken off, with multiple books always available now. However, later that month, Edward ran into an issue with someone complaining that the books were getting in the way. After discussing it with you, he came up with the solution of designating a specific shelf for the book exchange to keep things orderly. Now, as of today, the subway book share is still going strong after 2.5 months and has grown quite popular. Edward seems very fulfilled to have started this positive initiative that is bringing joy to other passengers.",
