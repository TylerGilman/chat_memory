    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sam over the past few months, leading up to today, July 18, 2024:\n\nIt all started back in early April when Sam came to your housewarming party. You were so excited to show off your new place, especially the kitchen you designed yourself. Sam brought you beautiful flowers and you two had a great time catching up that evening. The next day, Sam texted to thank you again and rave about your interior design skills. \n\nA few weeks later in early May, you invited Sam over for dinner to break in your new kitchen. The meal turned out amazing and Sam was blown away by your culinary talents. Later that month, Sam called to get your advice on color schemes for redecorating their living room. You had a long discussion about complementary colors and textures.\n\nIn mid-June, you met up with Sam for coffee and they excitedly told you they used a lot of your suggestions in their living room makeover. Sam said their friends were really impressed and several asked for your contact info to get design tips. Just last week, Sam texted you photos of another friend's apartment that totally copied your kitchen design! While flattering, you were a bit annoyed they didn't ask you first.\n\nOverall, it's been so fun developing a friendship with Sam these past few months, bonding over your shared love of interior design. Sam has really appreciated your keen eye and knack for decorating. You're excited to see how your friendship evolves and to hopefully collaborate on design projects together in the future.",
