2024-05-04 14:23 | You: Um, which of them is the better typist?
2024-05-04 14:25 | Jones: Well, Mary types faster than Jones. But I think Jones types more carefully.
2024-05-04 14:26 | You: Is there any difference in their short hand?
2024-05-04 14:28 | Jones: Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly, but Mary's short hand is the best in her class.
2024-05-04 14:29 | You: How about languages?
2024-05-04 14:31 | Jones: Both of them speak excellent French. But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does.
2024-05-04 14:32 | You: Um. That doesn't really matter. Because we have more French visitors than German.
2024-05-18 10:02 | You: Based on what we discussed, what's your recommendation on who we should hire?
2024-05-18 10:15 | Jones: Considering their overall skill sets, I'd lean towards hiring Mary. Her typing speed, top-notch shorthand, and language abilities seem to make her the stronger candidate.
2024-05-18 10:18 | You: Hmm, but Jones' carefulness in typing and quicker shorthand could be quite valuable too. It's a tough call.
2024-05-18 10:24 | Jones: You raise a good point. Jones' accuracy and shorthand speed are impressive. Perhaps I can do a more detailed written comparison of their strengths for you?
2024-05-18 10:26 | You: That would be really helpful. Let's plan to regroup after you pull that together.
2024-06-22 16:45 | Jones: I've completed my written assessment comparing Mary and Jones across the key administrative assistant criteria. In summary, while it's close, I believe Mary comes out ahead when considering the full breadth of skills needed for the role. Let me know if you would like me to walk through the details.
2024-06-22 16:52 | You: Thanks so much for putting that together, Jones. I really appreciate the thorough analysis. I'm inclined to agree with your recommendation to hire Mary based on your writeup. Let me review it in more detail and I'll let you know my final decision next week.
2024-06-25 09:35 | You: Jones, after carefully considering your assessment and the needs of the role, I've decided to offer the administrative assistant position to Mary. Can you please let her know and start the onboarding process?
2024-06-25 09:42 | Jones: Fantastic, I think you've made an excellent choice. Mary will be thrilled. I'll reach out to her right away and keep you updated on the onboarding. Congratulations!
2024-06-25 09:45 | You: Thanks for all your help with this hiring decision. I'm excited for Mary to join the team!
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Jones regarding the hiring decision between Mary and Jones for the administrative assistant position:

Back in early May, around 2024-05-04, you initially asked Jones to compare Mary and Jones' typing, shorthand and language skills. Jones felt that while Mary typed faster, Jones was more careful, and that Jones' shorthand was quicker but Mary's was the best in her class. When you asked about languages, Jones mentioned that both spoke excellent French, but that Mary's German was more fluent, which you noted was less relevant given the higher volume of French visitors.

The conversation picked up again a couple weeks later in mid-May when you asked Jones for his hiring recommendation. Jones suggested hiring Mary based on her overall skill set being a better fit. You pushed back, wondering if Jones' typing accuracy and shorthand speed might be more valuable. 

After a few more exchanges over the next month assessing their relative strengths, Jones sent you a detailed written comparison on 2024-06-22 recommending Mary as the best candidate when considering all factors. You thanked him for the thorough analysis.

Three weeks ago, on 2024-06-25, you informed Jones that after careful consideration, you decided to offer Mary the position. You asked him to let Mary know and begin the onboarding process. Jones congratulated you on the decision and said he would reach out to Mary right away.

Overall, this hiring process took nearly 2 months from early May to late June, with multiple discussions weighing Mary and Jones' qualifications. Jones' input and detailed assessment were valuable in helping you ultimately decide that Mary was the best fit for the administrative assistant role.
