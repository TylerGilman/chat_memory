[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Mr. Green over the past few months. It all started back on April 12th when you had that initial phone conversation to say goodbye before his flight the next day. You expressed regret about not being able to see him off in person due to an important meeting. 

The following week, on April 19th, you followed up to make sure he had arrived home safely. This led to a series of friendly exchanges over the next month, with Mr. Green sharing photos from his trip on May 3rd. 

A major development occurred in mid-May when you proposed a potential joint venture during a lengthy video call on the 16th. After some back and forth to iron out details, Mr. Green provisionally agreed to the partnership in principle just last week, on June 10th. 

Overall, what began as a farewell has evolved into an exciting new business opportunity that looks promising for both parties. The warm rapport you've developed over these past two months of regular communication should serve as a strong foundation as you embark on this collaborative project together.
