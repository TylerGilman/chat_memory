    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with the credit card applicant over the past few months:\n\nIt started back on April 23rd when they first reached out interested in applying for a credit card. You had a detailed conversation about their financial situation and history as a longstanding customer. A couple weeks later in early May, they submitted their official application which you helped them complete. There were some complications with verifying their employment in mid-May that delayed things, but you worked with them to get the necessary documentation sorted out. Finally, in early June, about a month and a half after that first conversation, you were able to approve their application and get their new card issued. They expressed their appreciation for your help throughout the process. Things have been quiet since then, but overall it was a successful interaction that strengthened their relationship with the bank.",
