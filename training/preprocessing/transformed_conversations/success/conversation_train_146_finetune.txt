[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with the logistics agent regarding sending computer equipment to your sister in Shanghai:

Back in early March, about two and a half months ago, you initially reached out to the logistics company to inquire about shipping a computer, keyboard, monitor, mouse and camera to your sister. The agent helpfully explained the pricing was generally 10 yuan per kilogram and had you weigh the items. 

A few weeks later in late March, you followed up to confirm the total cost and estimated delivery time. The agent quoted you a price of 350 yuan for the 35kg shipment, with delivery expected within 5 business days.

In mid-April, a month ago, your sister messaged you that the computer arrived but the monitor was damaged. You contacted the agent again and they apologized, offering a partial refund or replacement. After discussing with your sister, you requested a replacement monitor be sent.

Earlier this month, your sister confirmed receipt of the replacement monitor in good condition. You messaged the agent to thank them for resolving the issue. They appreciated your patience and said they hoped to serve you again in the future.

So in summary, over the past couple months you were able to successfully arrange shipment of the computer equipment to your sister, despite the complication with the damaged monitor, which the logistics company rectified for you satisfactorily in the end. Let me know if you need anything else!
