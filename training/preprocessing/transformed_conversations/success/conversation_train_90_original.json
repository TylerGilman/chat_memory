    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Daniel about visiting the wildlife sanctuary in Beijing, going back to your initial conversation in February. That first discussion really piqued Daniel's interest in seeing the sanctuary. You had a couple quick check-ins in March where he mentioned looking into trip details. Then in mid-April, Daniel reached out excited that he had booked a trip to Beijing in early June. Leading up to his trip, you had an in-depth conversation in late May where you shared more specifics on what to expect at the sanctuary, which he greatly appreciated. While Daniel was in Beijing in early June, he sent you some photos from his visit to the sanctuary, raving about the experience. He followed up after returning home to thank you again for the recommendation and share more details about his incredible trip. It's wonderful that your initial conversation six months ago led Daniel to have such a memorable wildlife experience during his travels.",
