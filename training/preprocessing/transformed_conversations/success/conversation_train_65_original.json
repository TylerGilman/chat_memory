    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sam over the past few months regarding your apartment search and move: \nBack in early April, you first brought up the idea of moving to a bigger place during a conversation at your cramped apartment. Sam agreed it was time for an upgrade. The next day, he excitedly texted you about a promising ad he found for a house rental with a garden and garage workshop - it sounded perfect. You had a few questions about the details that he quickly answered. \nA couple weeks later in mid-April, Sam let you know he had toured the place and really liked it. You discussed the pros and cons and decided to fill out an application. In early May, great news - your application was approved! You celebrated and started planning the move-in logistics. \nHowever, a few weeks ago in late May, the landlord reached out about a concerning issue with the current tenants not being out by the agreed date. This threw a wrench in your moving plans. After some stressful back-and-forth and waiting, thankfully it got resolved last week and your move-in date was only pushed by a few days. Phew!\nNow it's mid-June and you're finishing up the last of the packing before the big move tomorrow. It's been quite the roller coaster these past couple months with some twists and turns in the process, but you and Sam handled it together as a team. You're excited to start this new chapter in a home that better suits your needs and lifestyle. The garden and workshop are going to be amazing! Wishing you both all the best in this new space.",
