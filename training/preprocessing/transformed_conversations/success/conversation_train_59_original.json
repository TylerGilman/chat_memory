    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Philip over the past few months, Denise. It all started back in late May when you first congratulated him on winning that prestigious award at work. He was quite humble about it, but you could tell how much it meant to him. A couple weeks later in early June, you two got coffee and he shared more details about the award and his surprise at being chosen. It was nice to catch up and hear how well he's been doing. \n\nThen earlier this summer in mid-July, Philip reached out about a new project he's taking on and wanted your advice, since you have experience in a similar area. You had a great brainstorming session and came up with some promising ideas together. Just last week, Philip excitedly messaged you that the project got approved and he wanted to thank you again for your help and insight. Seems like Philip has had an exciting few months with the award and now spearheading this new initiative. You're really happy for him and glad you could support him through it all as a friend and colleague.",
