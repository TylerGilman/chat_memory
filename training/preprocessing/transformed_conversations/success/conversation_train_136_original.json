    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sarah over the past few months regarding your mutual friend Anna's pregnancy and fashion choices:\n\nBack in early April, you and Sarah had an in-person conversation where you expressed surprise that Anna was pregnant with her fifth child but still looking stylish in Prada. Sarah noted that Anna always maintains her fashionable image, attributing it to her Italian roots and perhaps expensive facial treatments. \n\nA week later, you messaged Sarah asking if Anna had revealed the baby's gender yet. Sarah said not officially, but she suspects it's a girl based on how Anna has been shopping. In early May, you checked in again, and Sarah confirmed Anna is expecting a girl and planning an elaborate Italian-themed baby shower.\n\nThree weeks ago, Sarah messaged you frustrated that Anna is still wearing 4-inch heels to work at 7 months pregnant. You noted that Anna has always been stubborn about compromising her style for anything. Last Tuesday, Sarah shared photos from Anna's extravagant baby shower, complete with a pasta bar and gelato cart. You both agreed Anna really went all out.\n\nThis morning, you reached out to Sarah again to see how Anna is doing. Sarah said Anna started her maternity leave and is probably relieved to finally be able to relax. You're both excited to meet baby Francesca soon and curious to see if motherhood will finally get Anna to adopt stretchy pants, at least for a little while.",
