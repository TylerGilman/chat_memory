    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Sam over the past few months regarding cooking duties and your relationship. It started back in early February when Sam was feeling exhausted one evening and asked you to make dinner instead. This sparked an ongoing discussion about dividing up cooking responsibilities more evenly. Over the next couple months, you had several conversations about meal planning and trying new recipes together. In late April, Sam expressed appreciation for you stepping up more in the kitchen, but also shared some stress about work. This led to a heartfelt discussion in mid-May where you both opened up about supporting each other through busy times. Just last week, you planned a special dinner to celebrate Sam's job promotion. Throughout this period, your thoughtful gestures and collaborative approach to household duties seems to have brought you closer together as a couple.",
