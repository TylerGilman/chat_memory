    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with John over the past several months regarding his mother's health and his caregiving role. It all started back in early February when you first checked in about his mother's condition. John shared that she was doing better and would be coming home from the hospital soon, though he planned to take a week off work to help her settle in and clean her place, showing his dedication as a son. \n\nIn March, you touched base again and John revealed his mother had taken a turn for the worse, requiring him to extend his time off work. You offered both emotional support and practical suggestions for professional caregiving assistance. By late April, John's mother stabilized but he was struggling with the demands of caregiving and work. You had some lengthy discussions about finding balance and encouraged him to care for his own needs too.\n\nEarlier this summer in June, John shared the wonderful news that his sister had moved nearby and was sharing the caregiving load, giving him some much needed respite. And just last month in July, you got an update that John's mother had recovered enough for him to return to work part-time, a huge relief after nearly 6 months of intensive caregiving. Throughout this challenging time, your friendship provided a consistent source of support and encouragement as John navigated his mother's health challenges and his role as a devoted son.",
