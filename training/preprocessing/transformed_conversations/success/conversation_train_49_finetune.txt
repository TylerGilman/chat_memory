2024-04-12 16:45 | You: Thanks for sharing! The part about "hiring for potential, not just experience" really resonated with me. I'm curious, how did you approach building and motivating your team as Propaganda minister?
2024-04-12 16:55 | Candidate: Absolutely, that's such an important insight. When I assembled my team, I focused on finding people with complementary strengths who were passionate about our mission. I tried to give them opportunities to take ownership of projects that aligned with their interests. We had regular brainstorming sessions to solicit everyone's ideas. I also made sure to celebrate wins and give credit where due. It was fulfilling to see shy first-years really come out of their shells and become confident leaders in their own right.

2024-05-09 11:30 | Candidate: Thanks for checking in! The more I reflect on it, the more I realize how much my time as Propaganda minister and on the basketball team shaped my approach to work. Collaborating with my peers on the student council taught me so much about effective communication, while basketball ingrained the importance of being a team player. I honed my organizational skills juggling multiple priorities. Perhaps most importantly, both experiences instilled a strong work ethic and ability to motivate myself and others towards a common goal. I believe these qualities would enable me to thrive in the role and add value to your team.
