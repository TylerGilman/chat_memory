    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Dave regarding your potential job change, Zina. It all started back in early May when you first confided in Dave that you were considering leaving the company for WebTracker, our main competitor. He was shocked but agreed to keep it between you two. A couple weeks later in mid-May, you had a more in-depth discussion where you explained your motivations and Dave shared his concerns but ultimately said he would support your decision. Then last month in June, you let Dave know you had interviewed with WebTracker and it went well. He cautioned you again to be careful, especially around Elvin who might retaliate if he found out. Finally, just last week, you excitedly told Dave that you got the job offer from WebTracker and planned to accept. While sad to see you go, he congratulated you and promised to stay in touch. So in the span of about 2.5 months, you went from first floating the idea to now being on the verge of making the leap to WebTracker, with Dave being your main confidant throughout the process.",
