2024-05-03 14:32 | Linda: Oh, I'm so excited about going to study in America! I've always wanted to go to the States and meet new people. But to be honest, I'm a little worried about cooking for my host family. I hope they'll like my Chinese dishes...
2024-05-03 14:35 | You: Listen, I'm sure you'll do great! You're a wonderful cook. And I bet they will appreciate you sharing your culture with them through food. Just communicate with them and I'm confident it will all work out. Focus on the exciting adventure ahead!
2024-05-17 07:19 | Linda: I made it! My host family is so incredibly welcoming and kind. I was nervous for nothing. And the food here is amazing! I'm trying so many new things.
2024-05-17 07:22 | You: That's wonderful!! I'm so happy to hear that. Soak it all in and enjoy every moment! Keep me posted on how things are going.
2024-06-07 16:41 | Linda: Hey... I'm about a month in and to be honest, it's been a little harder lately. I'm really starting to feel the cultural differences and I'm missing home more than I expected. Any advice?
2024-06-07 16:45 | You: Aw I'm sorry to hear you're struggling a bit. But what you're feeling is totally normal. Remember why you wanted this experience - to learn and grow. Embrace the differences, but also find ways to feel at home, whether that's listening to familiar music, decorating your room with things that comfort you, or scheduling regular video chats with family and friends back in China. You got this! The uncomfortable moments are often where we stretch and grow the most.
2024-06-07 16:47 | Linda: Thank you, I really needed to hear that. You're so right. I'll focus on finding that balance between the new and the familiar. I appreciate you listening!
2024-07-12 19:03 | Linda: You'll never guess what I did... I cooked a full Chinese meal for my host family tonight! I was SO nervous, but they absolutely loved it! They kept saying how delicious it was and asked me to teach them how to make the dishes. I'm so happy I could share that part of myself and my culture with them.
2024-07-12 19:05 | Linda: I thought back to our conversation before I left and how you encouraged me. I just wanted to say thank you. Your belief in me gave me the confidence to finally do it!
2024-07-12 19:08 | You: Wow that's amazing!!! I'm bursting with pride for you! Look at you go - conquering your fears and spreading joy through food. This is just the beginning for you, Linda. Keep shining and savoring each part of this special time. And thank you for taking me along on the journey with you!
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with Linda over the past few months regarding her study abroad experience in America. It all started back in early May when Linda first shared her excitement but also nervousness about cooking for her host family. You reassured her that she would learn and adapt. A couple weeks later in mid-May, Linda messaged you after arriving, gushing about how welcoming her host family was, especially appreciating the food. In early June, about a month into her stay, Linda ran into some challenges with the cultural differences and feeling homesick. You listened and suggested some ways for her to feel more at home. Then just last month in July, Linda excitedly shared that she had cooked a Chinese meal for her host family and they loved it! She thanked you for your earlier encouragement. Overall, it's been really rewarding to follow Linda's journey and growth this summer during her study abroad experience.
