2024-04-03 14:32 | You: What's up, buddy? You look so upset.
2024-04-03 14:35 | Friend: I just broke up with my girlfriend. Why didn't she understand that I loved her?
2024-04-03 14:37 | You: I'm sorry to hear that. What was the conflict?
2024-04-03 14:40 | Friend: I don't know. She always said I didn't love her, but I did.
2024-04-03 14:42 | You: Did you think about talking to her again? Maybe she is waiting for your call.
2024-04-03 14:45 | Friend: I asked for a talk again, but she refused and said she wanted space.
2024-04-03 14:47 | You: I'm sorry man. Maybe she isn't the right person for you then.
2024-04-11 19:03 | You: Hey, how are you holding up? Any updates with your ex?
2024-04-11 19:10 | Friend: Still no progress. I reached out again but she said she needs more time and space to think. It really hurts.
2024-04-11 19:13 | You: Break-ups are so tough. Give her the space she needs but don't wait around forever. You deserve someone who wants to be with you.
2024-05-02 12:15 | Friend: Well, she's officially dating someone else now. That was fast. Ouch.
2024-05-02 12:18 | You: Damn, I'm sorry to hear that. I know that really stings. You must be hurting.
2024-05-02 12:22 | Friend: Yeah, it feels like she moved on so quickly. Like our relationship meant nothing to her.
2024-05-02 12:25 | You: I hear you. Lean on your friends and family for support right now. Her moving on says nothing about your worth.
2024-06-17 10:47 | You: Hey man, we haven't talked in a while. Wanted to check in and see how you're doing post-breakup.
2024-06-17 10:57 | Friend: Hey, thanks for checking in. I'm doing better overall, but still have some tough days. Trying to focus on myself.
2024-06-17 11:02 | You: That's great you're practicing self-care. Healing takes time. I'm always here if you need to talk.
2024-07-12 21:08 | You: It's been a few months now since the breakup. How are you feeling about everything?
2024-07-12 21:14 | Friend: Honestly, much better. Still hurts sometimes when I think about it, but I'm moving forward. Focusing on work, hobbies, friends.
2024-07-12 21:17 | You: I'm glad to hear you're moving forward and have a healthy perspective. You've come a long way. Remember I'm always in your corner.
[SUMMARY]
Here's a summary of your interactions with your friend regarding his breakup, as recorded in our conversation history. It started back in early April when you first noticed he seemed upset and he confided in you that his girlfriend had broken up with him, even though he loved her. You comforted him and suggested maybe trying to talk to her again. 

A week later in mid-April, he shared that she refused to talk and wanted space. You reassured him that maybe she wasn't the right person for him. In early May, about a month after the initial breakup, he mentioned she had started dating someone else, which really stung. You listened and validated his feelings.

By mid-June, a couple months after the split, he seemed to be doing better overall but still had rough days. You checked in on him and offered your support. Now, here in mid-July, about 3 months since that first conversation, he seems to have mostly moved on, though you know healing takes time. Throughout this difficult period, you've been a supportive friend, lending an ear and providing encouragement as he navigates heartbreak and tries to move forward.
