    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Craig over the past few months regarding his health. Back in early June, around 3 months ago, Craig first mentioned to you that he had a terrible cold. You expressed concern and suggested he get rest and try drinking garlic cooked in chicken stock. A week later, you checked in and he said he was starting to feel a bit better after taking your advice. However, by the end of June his symptoms returned and seemed to be getting worse. Worried it might be something more serious, you urged Craig to see a doctor. In mid-July, about a month ago, Craig informed you that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia and was on antibiotics. The illness really took a toll on him both physically and emotionally. You offered support and reassurance during his recovery. Now, as of today in mid-August, Craig reports he is finally feeling much better and his health seems to be back on track. Looking back, this illness ended up being quite an ordeal for Craig over the course of the summer, but fortunately with proper medical care and rest he was able to fully recover.",
