    "personal_summary": "Here's a summary of your interactions with Alex over the past few months regarding shopping and your friendship. It all started back in early February when you invited Alex to join you for the big sale at Broadway Mall. He declined, saying he was broke and found window shopping boring. You ended up going alone. \n\nA week later in mid-February, you checked in to see how Alex was doing financially. He opened up about being stressed about money and his job situation. You offered support and suggested some low-cost activities you could do together. \n\nIn March, Alex excitedly messaged you saying he found a new job. You congratulated him and made plans to celebrate with dinner, your treat. Things were looking up.\n\nHowever, in April Alex seemed distant. After a few weeks, you reached out and discovered he was overwhelmed adjusting to his new job. You had a long phone call, listened to his concerns, and reassured him. \n\nAs summer arrived in June, you invited Alex to join you and some other friends on a weekend beach trip. He was hesitant at first, worried about the cost, but you worked out an affordable plan. The trip went great and Alex seemed more relaxed than he had in months.\n\nNow, in mid-July, your friendship with Alex has grown a lot since that initial conversation about the mall sale. You've supported each other through ups and downs, and found ways to have fun together even when money is tight. You appreciate how your friendship has deepened over the past 5 months.",
