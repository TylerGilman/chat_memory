It was almost two o'clock in the morning when I finally fell asleep.\n#Person2#: Are you worried about something? Why couldn't you sleep?\n#Person1#: You know how it is when you're in a strange country. Everything is new, and you get tired and nervous sometimes. Then you worry about your family, about conditions back home, about your courses, about your money, about everything. I tried to fall asleep but I just had too much on my mind.\n#Person2#: Well, take it easy. Things will look better tomorrow. Maybe you should try exercising or a hot bath to help you relax.\n#Person1#: Anything is worth a try. But right now I really just want to find a quiet place to take a nap."
