    "dialogue": "#Person1#: What is your favorite coffee?\n#Person2#: Irish coffee is my favorite. But I'm not particular on it.\n#Person1#: All right. Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home?\n#Person2#: Not very often. Making coffee is a bit troublesome. Most of the time, I just buy takeout at Starbucks. And also, I quite like instant coffee.\n#Person1#: I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular. Though its taste is not perfect, it's really cheap and convenient.\n#Person2#: Exactly. Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee. People love it all over the world.\n#Person1#: I agree. I heard that in the western countries, almost everyone likes coffee. Is that true?\n#Person2#: Yes. No doubt about that. For us, coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink. I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee.\n#Person1#: No, we don't, especially the elder people. But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays.\n#Person2#: I suppose so. That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now."
