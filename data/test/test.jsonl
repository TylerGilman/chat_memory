You suggested she take a break to watch a football match with you instead, but she refused, calling it a \"stupid match\". Tensions rose as you called her selfish for monopolizing the TV. \n\nA few weeks later in late April, you had a serious talk with Nancy about finding a compromise on TV time. She agreed to limit her soap operas to an hour per day so you could watch your documentaries too. However, by mid-May you noticed she was slipping back into her old habits, often sneaking in extra episodes when you weren't around. \n\nThings came to a head in early June when you got into a big argument about her dishonesty and lack of consideration. Nancy finally admitted she had an unhealthy addiction to the melodrama and needed help. You supported her as she talked to a therapist and developed better viewing habits.\n\nNow, as the summer winds down, your relationship is in a much better place. Nancy still enjoys her favorite shows but is no longer consumed by them. She makes an effort to spend more quality time with you and seems genuinely happier overall. Looking back, that first confrontation in April was the wakeup call Nancy needed to make a positive change. Your patience and support made all the difference."}

After some back and forth, you were able to compromise and attend both events. \n\nA few weeks later in mid-May, Linda texted asking for your opinion on a new job opportunity. You had a long phone call discussing the pros and cons. Then just last week, you surprised Linda with a thoughtful gift, referencing an inside joke from your hiking picnic two months ago. She was really touched.\n\nOverall, it's been an exciting few months getting to know Linda better. Despite the small conflict in May, you've grown closer through a variety of shared experiences, from the initial movie date, to the hiking trip, concert compromise, career discussion, and heartfelt gift.

You congratulated her and reminisced about the tooth fairy visiting you at that age. \n\nThen, in mid-May, you checked in to see how she was doing. Su excitedly told you she got a new bike and was learning to ride it. You shared a story about when you learned to ride a bike too. Finally, earlier this month, Su sent you a photo of herself grinning with a gap in her teeth, proudly showing off the space where she lost another tooth. It's been sweet to watch Su growing up and reaching new milestones over these past couple months since her 7th birthday party in April. Let me know if you need anything else!"}

In the following weeks, you texted back and forth a few times to share ice cream recommendations. Then in mid-April, Alex tried an unusual garlic ice cream that sounded absolutely revolting to you. As spring turned to summer, you met up again in person and Alex shared photos from the garlic ice cream experience, which looked as awful as it sounded. In June, you excitedly told Alex about an amazing chocolate hazelnut gelato you discovered. Last month in July, you two had a long phone chat catching up about your summer adventures and Alex mentioned finding a great new ice cream spot to try together soon. Just last week, you texted to firm up plans to meet there this coming weekend to sample their unique flavors. It's been really fun bonding with Alex over the past 5 months through your mutual love of ice cream (minus the garlic incident). Trying out new places and flavors together has become a nice tradition in your friendship."}

He was ultimately supportive and even offered to write a recommendation letter. \n\nOver the next few months, you had several follow-up conversations. In early March, you provided more details on your exciting new role. Then in mid-April, you ran into some complications with the job transition which you confided in Mr. White about. He gave you some helpful advice drawing from his own career experiences. As your end date approached in late April, you and Mr. White had a longer discussion reflecting on your time at the company. He shared how much he valued you as an employee and wished you the very best.\n\nAfter your last day on April 30th, you kept in touch, letting him know in mid-May that you were settling well into the new job. He was glad to hear it. Your final exchange was just last month in July, when out of the blue Mr. White reached out to see how things were going. You had a nice catch up and he again reiterated that he's happy to provide a reference anytime. All in all, it's been a significant progression over the past 6 months, but you've appreciated Mr. White's support throughout the major transition in your career."}

The situation first came to light on March 12th when Susan informed you out of the blue that she was taking over the account you had been working on for a month and a half. Apparently this decision was made the previous week without your knowledge while you were meeting with the client, Mr. Wei. \n\nOver the following weeks, you expressed your frustration to Susan and tried to get clarity on why the decision was made. In early April, about 3 weeks after first learning of the change, you had a lengthy discussion with Susan where she provided more context - apparently Mr. Emory, your boss, felt things were moving too slowly and wanted a \"fresh start\", but failed to inform you directly. While this provided some insight, you still felt slighted.\n\nAs spring progressed, you mostly moved on but the issue came up again in May when you were accidentally left off a key meeting invite regarding the Silk account. This resurfaced some of the earlier communication and process issues. You had a pointed conversation with Susan in late May where you re-emphasized the need for better communication and inclusion going forward.\n\nNow, in mid-July, the Silk account transition occurred over 4 months ago. While there are still occasional frustrations, you've mostly settled into the new normal and are focused on other accounts. Susan has made efforts to improve communication and keep you in the loop, but it remains an area for continued growth. Looking back, while the initial handling was far from ideal, you're doing your best to be professional and move forward productively."}

You walked them through the process over a series of messages. Then in mid-April, about a month ago, they contacted you again for advice on recording voice memos, which you were happy to provide. \n\nMost recently, just last week, they sent you a very kind message thanking you for all your help and great customer service. They mentioned how much they appreciate having a knowledgeable and friendly resource like you for questions and said they'll definitely be back to purchase from your store again in the future. Looking back over the past couple months, it's been great to develop a nice rapport with this customer and know that your attentive service has earned their trust and ongoing business."}

It all started about a month and a half ago on June 1st when Tom first called to place an order for a dozen long-stem red carnations to be delivered to his mother's apartment on June 17th. You took down all the details and processed his Visa payment. \n\nThe delivery went smoothly and his mother loved the flowers. Tom called back the next week to thank you personally. Then in early July, about two weeks ago, Tom reached out again wanting to send another bouquet for his mother's birthday on July 30th. This time he requested an assortment of summer flowers in bright colors.\n\nLast week, you followed up with Tom to confirm the birthday flower delivery details. Everything was on track. Then yesterday, Tom's assistant Angela called to add a box of gourmet chocolates to the birthday order. She said Tom wanted to make sure this birthday was extra special.\n\nSo in summary, over the past month and a half you've helped Tom send two lovely flower arrangements to brighten his mother's day - carnations in mid-June, and a colorful summer bouquet with chocolates for her late July birthday. Your attention to detail and personal customer service have made Tom a very satisfied loyal customer. Great job, Shareen!"}

Throughout the spring, you kept in touch, with John checking in to see if you had any other questions before your trip. In May, you realized you weren't sure about luggage on the subway, so John provided more detailed guidance. As summer approached and your travel date got closer, you had a longer conversation where John shared some of his own travel experiences and tips for navigating the airport. He even offered to meet you at the subway station on your departure day to help with your luggage and make sure you caught the right train. That was a few weeks ago now. With your trip coming up in just a couple days, you messaged John yesterday to confirm the plan, and he assured you he'll be there to help. You're feeling much more confident about the whole journey thanks to John's ongoing support and friendship over the past several months."}

In March, Javier responded that his hands were tied for now but suggested revisiting terms after a few more successful deals together. \n\nIn early May, you met again in person and Javier shared that his company might have some flexibility on a case-by-case basis for trusted partners. Hopeful, you emailed him a specific proposal in late May. After a few weeks with no response, you checked in again in mid-June.\n\nFinally, earlier this month in August, Javier got back to you apologetically. He explained that after further internal discussions, they decided they couldn't budge on the L/C requirement yet. However, he reiterated his desire to continue working together and building trust. \n\nAs of today, August 15, 2024, the payment terms remain an obstacle but the door seems open to revisiting the discussion after more successful transactions.

Back in early February, you gave the initial homework assignment of reading pages 12-20 and doing exercises 1-10. You clarified students didn't need to type it. You also mentioned they should get calculators and might have a quiz on the day's notes. \n\nIn mid-March, the student followed up asking if the homework was due before or after spring break. You said after break was fine. In April, they had trouble with one of the homework exercises and you walked through it together after class. Most recently last week, the student asked if calculators would be allowed on the upcoming test and you confirmed yes. Overall, the student has been diligent about assignments and you've helped clarify expectations and material when needed."}
